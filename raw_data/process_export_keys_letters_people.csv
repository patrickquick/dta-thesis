The tithe day is given as 22nd April./(2) lst August./(3) Although Parson Saxby dated his letter 17th April 1541, and it has been calendared as such in Letters &  Papers, it seems as if he may have slipped up on the month and written April when he meant March - he had been writing about the April tithe day. If the error is accepted, the letter should be dated 17th March 1542 (N.S.), the spring when John was beginning to think about living at Polbroke, as bothe Howhem and Saxbys letters (3 and 7) show. Parson Saxby himself had not been presented to the living of Polbroke until November 1541, and it is also rather unlikely that two letters with exactly the same subject matter as Letters 6 and 7 could have been written in two separate years. Parson Saxby seems to have written this letter from Peterborough just before he rode off to Buckinghamshire to visit Anthony Cave. Arriving at Tickford, he found that his cousin had ridden to London and so sent another, much fuller letter after them (Letter 7) in which he refers to this one./(4) "Delyvar" has been preferred to the reading "delyver" in Letters & Papers.	sara	60f69a188a5426a2323425d7			Thomas	Male	Saxby			Parson of Polebrook	sara		60af9ecbf038043336624b28	Johnson & Company	xx-xx-1514	John	Male	Johnson		Protestant	Merchant; draper and stapler	sara

In para. 3 below he asks John to write to William Gifford at Antwerp for sturgeon. Gifford acknowledged the request (Letter 10), but John apparently had also written to Henry Southwick, who bought and shipped the sturgeon home to England. (Letter 12)./(2) The second paragraph of this letter, the third paragraph down to "Jhesus.", and the postscript from "I thynke" to the end, are in the hand of Caves apprentice Richard Johnson. The rest of the letter is in Anthony Cave's own handwriting.	sara	60ed97bf55947e60cc7375ed			Anthony	Male	Cave		Protestant	Draper and merchant of the Staple in Buckinghamshire; friend of John's father; John was apprenticed to him	sara		60af9ecbf038043336624b28	Johnson & Company	xx-xx-1514	John	Male	Johnson		Protestant	Merchant; draper and stapler	sara

What shall followe of the rest that is to come from Floore, I nor he can judge, but I doubte rather wurse than better: for your packer in the countre of thies that we have receyved hadde marked 3 of them for Cottes and but one Barkes, and yet you perceave what thay come unto./I made offre unto Anthony White of this that is packed, according to your writing, but he sayed unto me that he could not tell whether the s[t]raunger wold be content to receave his bargain hier or not. Yowe shall perceave his mynd (as I suppose) by his aunswer hierinclosed, which he sent me this morening, withoute speking with him: as you se cause so certefye me further, also what you will have done with your Sybbertofte wull, for if Mr. Haynes go ones to Mr. Cave's buysines, it shal be very harde getting of him away to serve anny part of your pourpos until it be late in the yeir, and so he advised me to advertise you he wil be spared from Mr. Cave's as long as shal be possible for him, for to do you pleasur therby./Mr. Smyth haeth no 101i of youres to spare, as you write that you perceave by his reconing that ther shuld be lefte so for you at Calleis, for of the 230li 0s 0d_st.

The rest I have done sins and befor the receyt of your sayd lettres, as th'ordre of them haeth required./The monney that you writt to be taken up by exchaunge for the payementes of the Cold Maert, was happely differred, for if so moche hast hadde ben nedefull in taking of it as it semed by your often and ernest writing, you shuld have payed dierly for it: for th'exchaunge at sight is nowe not under 26s 9d, and at double usance Mr. Smyth haeth payed for Mr. Cave's accompt 27s 6d. But nowe that some more respite is enlarged, I trust to spede your pourpos better chieppe. Mr. Haynes is yet unpayed by reasone of Cornelis Franzon's slakkenes, as you may perceave by Henry Suthwyke's lettre hierinclos[ed]; howebeit, I have made a shifte of myself to have payed the said Mr. Haynes 20li st. in fayer gold, and therwith he is yett contented.(1a)/Your rest in Henry's haundes aforesayd I cannot fynde monney for hier in London reasonably, and therfor I do write to him this day to send me over the same trustely. The shipping (1b) is appointed or (at leest) denominated to begynne the morrowe after Midlent Sonday. (2b) Howebeit yesterday, at the receyt of your lettre of the 26th in the last, Mr. Anthony Cave and Mr. Smyth shewed me that thay suppose it wil not be than, by reasone of lakke of shippes mete for the pourpos and maarriners, which ar putt dayly so moche unto the Kinge's buysines (3b) that it is very moche douted that your said shipping of force shal be deferred longer; more than this cannot I advise you presently, and therfor use your affaires according; and as I here further you shal be certefyed therof as I may gett convayaunce of my lettres unto you, which is harder to do than ever I knewe it. The carryar of Newington cometh no more at me, and I have nobody to send unto him, and therfor looke for nothing that way. The barras canvas I cannot as yett for my lyff send unto you, but when I can I wil not be negligent. Seedes for my syster's newe gardens shal be sent with the same, for otherwayes I have no convayaunce. This present I send to Thomas Flecton to Tykeford, to be sent you expressely by reasone you require so ernestly to knowe the certaintye of the shipping./I have a long mater to write you of concerning my goyng ove[r] with my maister (which I can in nowise avoyed), but the tyme doeth not serve me nowe to write it.

This berar was told the childe's name for to have shewed me, but it fell besides his hoerse or owte of his pannyardes by the way. Onely he doeth remembre (as he sayeth) that Jacob's wiff was so named in th'Old Testament, which I knowe not but if it wer Rachel. Ther is no great force in the mater, considering that all thing is to Gode's glory and my syster's comfort and youres, with all your frendes hier./Mr. Anthony Cave continueth moche after one sorte, saving that Doctour Augustyne sayeth that he haeth none agewe nor other disease but wekenes, and himself confes/s/eth that if he might retourne to his stomake or appetite, and sleape, he shuld soone after recover strenght ynough to gett away from this Cite, by reasone wherof, he willed me to send you word nowe,that he trusteth that it shal not be nedefull for you to retourne hiether agen for nothing that concerneth him. He doeth thanke you for your paynestaking at Tykeford, and rejoyseth with my syster and you for your newe Chrystyan increase, and commences him veray ernestiy unto you boeth./From Calleis by Spenders shippe, the day of your departing hens, 1 receyved your maunde with stueff, and other trinkettes owte ot tne maistere's chest; but of your arneys and other artelery from my brother Lake, I heare nothing.

But yett (perchaunce) it shall not nede, in case Mr. Cave do perfaictiy amend by than, for peradventure he will lend me a hoerse himself to kepe him compaigny home to Tykeford; which I may not refuse to do, if I am required therunto, as you knowe. The next weke I trust to certefye you perfaictly hierof, and of other requisites./The Cll st. by excnaunge is not yett delyvered, nor I cannot tell when it shal be, for th'exchaunge falleth dayly; ther is monney plenty nowe in tne Streat for usaunce at 26s 10d.

The Council said that the ships were laden with herring (it was forbidden to convey victuals to France),while other merchandise belonged to Frenchmen.

Wherfor he desireth you to take paines to ryde towardes Inggarsby this weke for to mete ther with Sir Ambrose Cave, of whom you shall lerne his mynde concerning certain maters of consequence betwext him and you, and therappon to sett some due ordre therin; which so taken betwen Sir Ambrose and you, he wold gladly be certefyed of the same with spede by your owne coming hiether to London, as shortely after as conveniently your owne affaires may suffer, oneles he do recover the more presently, wherof you shall be certefyed continually as I may have a messenger to write.

He wold knowe what ordre (and with whom) you left for the sending niether of them. Hier is a chaffer and an oven of mettell receyved with maistres Fyssher's andyrons: send word what is to be done with them./Mr. Maister of Sandwich is come to this Cite and haeth brougnt Peter his sone with him, intending to leave him hier for you.

As touching suche wulles as you have shipped for me, and made sale of parte of them in the contre for lack of caryage: and in case you had solde the rest at London as you have done your awne, I coulde have bene therwith right well content, and might be reconned unreasonable if I wolde /not/, knowing (as I do) howe diligent you have bene at all tymes in myne affaires, and howe honestly md truely you have dealt with me hetherto. Master Johnson, I do right hartely thancke you for the good /bere/ you sent me, albeit that a great parte of the same hathe bene dronke with moche, moche lamentation and mournynge. For apon Palme Sondaye (1a) in the mornynge percevid we manifestly that John Crant (which had complayned vij dayes before) was sicke of the plage, wherapon I and all my householde were glad to voide my howse. The same self daye after evinsonge, Margery, oon of my sister Plancknei's doughters, waxed sodenly sick also of the same dysease, wherapon my said sister forsoke her awne house also, with suche wares as she had in her shope, and went to my garden in Masondue Strete, where she and I with a great nombre of yonge frute do contenue in great sorowe and hevines of harte, God be mercyfull unto us, helpe and comfort us. And what shall become of these two sick persons we are uncerten yet, but they are very weake and feble. They be in Gode's hand, Almighti God be mercyfull unto them, and restore them their health again yf it be His pleasure. Thus dothe God chastyce and scourge me from tyme to tyme (first by the death of my husbandes, then by the deathe of my two brethren-en-lawe, my sister's husbandes, and nowe with John Crant, on whome of late I bestowed so great cost) to kepe me in awe and under correction styll. I beseche His almighti goodnes, evin as He dayely reneweth my sorowe and hevines, so mercyfully to send me patience in all my trouble and adversyt/e/, and to obtein the same the better, I desire you and good Master Cave to praye for me.

Their is not only narrowe serche for the passinge of vitteilles into Englond owt of Flaunders, but allso penalties of great somes of monney, besydes the forfayteur of the thinge. (2a)/1 I cowld bye their Frenche wynes to send into Englond, but then their is a restranct that no Frenche wares maye come into Englond withowt espetiall lycens. I wrytte theirfore to my brother Otwell to make provisyon for you at London, or ellis to send me word yf a man maye send thether anny wyne for his awne howse withowt danger or forfayteur (3a) Spyces and suger I have provided you, accordinge to your remembraunce./Yeasternyght at my commynge hether, I fownd your lettre dated at Yngarsbie the 29 jour of the last monneth, (1b) perceyvinge theirby you have receyved the ij lettres I sent you before my goinge hens into Flaunders, and the fyrst lettre I wrot you after my commynge to Andwerpe./As moche as consernyth your busynes done in Flaunders (for th'order wherof in your said lettre ye wryte your mynde), in my last lettres sent you I have wryton you howe I have used the same, and of the deliveringe over for your accompt of ijCli st., mer st., by exchaunge, (2b) and theirfore I omyt the declaringe of it agayne, and convert myselfe to tha'nsweringe of the contayntes of the rest of your lettre not yeat answered./Where ye thincke yt not reasonable that ye showld forbear the monney that ye showld have of me for the felles, and for the full of the ijCli st. that ye showld have of the monney of Willmotte's, thowghe their remayne xiiij M. felles yeat on my haundes, of the which ye shall have as moche proffyt as I, the trewthe is if it be not reason then I wold ye dyd not forbear yt, and I shal be content other to paye you your monney by the tyme ye apoynt in your lettre, or elles deliver you iiij M. felles even as ye desyre to have, which maye be done indyfferently and parted equally, for they be apon themselffes and not mengled with my felles. The honest portion of monney that ye wryt of that is receyved for felles, is not past xx or xxxli more then the custome and chargis of the felles dothe amownt unto, and theirfore of that saill that I have alredie made I have yeat nether xxli nor xx markes' advauntage of, above the pricis they were rated at betwene us, but with kepinge of them their maye be more monney made, wherfore I can be content ye have your parte yf ye forbear your monney, as I am lyke to do; wneverthelesse, and thowghe I am able to abyde the market, yeat I were as good to sell them nowe as the market goithe as to kepe them a yeare (as I thineke I shall do some) and sell them for a noble more./I am s/u/re ye consyder a man shall do more good in th'employment of his monney then to kepe his felles a year and aunce the price a noble. I have kept xj M. felles of myne awne in this towne, part a year and parte lenger: yt had bene better for me to have sold them for xiiij nobles at the first then nowe for xvj nobles, all thinges consydered, and theirfore it is not allwais best to tarry longe for th'avauncement of the pryces of owre marchaundyses. Yf I had not or this tyme taken the first markettes of your felles, perchaunce ye wold not have lyked your reconynges so well as ye have done. Well, to make an end in this matter, I shal be content ye use yt as ye please, that is, ye shall other have monney or felles. Yf at my commynge into Englond (which by the loave of God shal be by Mydsomer) ye please to have monney, I shall provyd yt for you; yf yt please you to have felles. they shal be deliverid to whom ye please to apoynt; howbeit, my hope for all this is to dyspatche moest part of them or I comme over, yf the Hollanders comme betwen this and that./Towchinge soche monney as ye shall disburse nowe for felles more then I have done, I have wryton to my brother Otwell to furnyshe you, and theirfore I pray you stay not the buyinge of soche felles as ye exteme proffyt wyll ensewe./In the salle of your Marche wulles I can do nothinge, for your pryce is at leest xxxs in a serpler more then other men's and as the markyt goith, wherfore I cannot see but they must tarry other another markett, or another commyssion./Your Barkes wull I sold not, but our freind Henry Sowthweke, and I pra/y/ God ye never make worse reconnynge: I have some in my haundes I wold I had sold for the same pryce./At Brughes is a staye sett for Blason's debt. victor (1c) hath gotten a byll of him which is signed by hys aunt, Joes Diricken's wyfe, to deliver clothes for it within this xiiij dayes, so that I trust ye shal be no loser. As sonne as the clothes be receyved, Victor hath promysed to make saell of them, and to seind the monney to Andwerpe to Water Garwaye, who hathe in Robert Tempeste's abcens our busynes their. Oultre Blazon is nowe here, but I thincke he is lyke to retourne withowt wull. No man will trust hym./Vyctor commendith hym unto you, and prayeth you to send hym the sonest ye can Ponder's byll./Towching your matter with Sir Jonn Butler and for your howses at Barton's, I wyll do what I can by cownsell, and wryt you further hereafter./I have sett soche staye, with Robert Tempest hellpe, that whatsoever chaunceth I trust shal be well for your spetialties, and I am apoynted to whom I shall make soche bylles as I shall hereafter receyve. Whatsoever wyll ensewe hereafter, God knowith, but I mystrust not th'Emperour this somer for he is not yeat lyke to agre with the Garmaynes, and so longe I mystrust hym the lesse. (1d)/The Frenchemen have sent word they wyll comme hether. yf they comme within this xiiij dayes (as I thincke they wyll not, nor at no tyme), I will helpe defend the towne and our goodes. (2d) As the Lord God knowith, Who ever kepe you. In hast./By your servaunt,/John Johnson.//A clause annexed to Mr. Cave's lettre of the 7 of this present monethe of June./At my passing thorowe this towne into Flaunders, I had thought that the hole monney for the x serplers wull sold the Haerlamers, saving Lli st. that is dew this Pasche marte, had bene receavid by Robert Tempest at Andwerp, according to the bargaine wherof my brother Ambrose had before writton me to London to be even so; and therfore when I was heir I demandid no question of the same, but only whether the bill was sent to Andwerp, and when I was aunswerid Yea, I thought, as God be my help, that all the redie monney had bene at Andwerp. When /I c/am to Andwerp I demandid of Tempest yf the Harlamers had paid /him and/ he sad Yea, and so I passid the tyme ther nether taking monney nor accompt of Tempest in 8 daies, for I found no man redyly to do anny monney by exchaunge unto; but when I cam to receyve mo/nne/y of /Temp/est, I perseavid that he had receyved but 130li st., and that the bill was dew in the marte to be but 50li st. I thought plainly that ther had bene some oversight, forsomoche as of the 10 serplers wull ther lackyd 90li st., and wrote the sonest I possipble cowld hether to Callais, to be certefied of the trewthe from Henry Sowthwicke and Ambrose Saunders, thincking vearyly ther had bene some oversight: aunswer wherto I had none untill I cam to Bruges, wher I found Henry Sowthweke bound to Andwerp, and he bothe showed me and brought me a lettre from Ambrose that the same 90li st. was heir receyved in redie monney in crownes sol., crownes rose, and Ambrose affirmyth that he showed me therof or I departid hens, but as God help me,I remember it not./To conclude, this is the veary cause that ye had not iijCli st. delyverd over by exchaunge according to your commyssion, for I had it not of redie monney of your billes dew in the maert paiementes, which be even now in haund, and so I do take to my accompt this monney that I found heir, which cometh all to one purpose, and ye shal not neade to make over anny monney by exchaunge for th'aunswering of your billes these paiementes; for besydes that (as before is sayd) all thinges is sorrowed for, yt wold be to late now to make anny monney over for the paiementes, considring thatt all good men's paiementes wil be made within this vj or viij dailies at the farthest./Thus, etc.	sara	60af9ecbf038043336624b28	Johnson & Company	xx-xx-1514	John	Male	Johnson		Protestant	Merchant; draper and stapler	sara		60ed97bf55947e60cc7375ed			Anthony	Male	Cave		Protestant	Draper and merchant of the Staple in Buckinghamshire; friend of John's father; John was apprenticed to him	sara

Thies ij dayes past, per Peter Brake and one Raeff Chamberlayne, I sent you aunswer of dyvers your late lettres, but sins my last, I have tryed the weight of your angelles by th'once weight, which I fynde so light that the proffit of thole ijC of them will not amont to iiij angelles, which is to lytle gaines to putt your sayd monney into the Mynte and to tarry a monneth for the retourne of the same from thens, namely considering the preparacion that you have willed me by your former lettres to make for you of monney, agenst your coming over./I do therfor passe over the putting fourth of the game your gold, and xlli st. more or theraboute, lykewise in old angelles, that I hadde befor in my haundes, rather than for so small proffite to disapoint you of mony at your ryding next home, after your sayd coming hiether; for to my syster your wiff I have sent no more monney than the vij^XXli st. that I writt unto you of, while you wer at Andwarpe, for lakke of a trusty berar. Emonges other thinges, I have moche nede of a small pile and ballance./Of Maistres Fayrey nor Anthony White her sone, I have as yet receyved no monney for thayer imployementes, but agenst your coming lx or Lli st. (at leest) wil be made redy, as the foresayd Anthony haeth lately promised me, and also all the monney that you can make of the sale of her wulles at Calleis, shall remayne in your haundes towardes the said newe imployementes./The sale of o1d wull nowe hier to cloethyers is at a pointe for th/e/ yeir, bycause that moost countres do shere shepe veray yerly this yeare, and so I have lefte of youres thole serpler that come last from Harrysone of Maistres Tourner's wull, and x or xij todde more of Mr. Druelle's loed, wherunto you added all your middell wull.

All the residue (if you thinke good, and so send worde shortely) he thinketh best to make the best of yt, and so packe it into pockettes agenst the next shipping./Two pockettes of middell Cottes that wer left of the last shipping, Thomas Wymer haeth hadde away this weke, but monney shal not be hadde for them untill the next weke after this nowe coming.

OTWELL JOHNSON TO JOHN JOHNSON//At London, the 10th in July, 1545//With right harty comendacions, brother, this shall do you to witt that youres from Tykeford I receyveod within ij dayes after your departing thens home to your wiff, who I trust is restored to perfaict helth by your presens with her, wherof I wold right gladly heare. I have lakked a messenger for to have aunswered your foresayd lettre befor this, and also to have certefyed you of other thinges requisite, and therfor nowe you shal be hier more at large advertised of all./And first you shall understond thut within thies iij dayes manny Englisshe marchsntes ar come owte of Flanders by stelth for feare of a newe arrest, which the talking is that withoute doubt it is in haund by this present day at Andwarpe and Barrowe, as th'other was, and yett the Dyett not ended that can heare, for the commissioners ar not yet separated. (1a) Hier in the Temmes and elliswher on the water, all shippes ar arrested, as well hoyes laden for Flanders as other, but to what end or poupos I am uncertain. Dyvers tales runne abrode therof: when I can lerne mor perfaictly the trueth of thinges, you shal be made participant of the same by writing right shortely after. In the measne tyme, take this advertisement in wourth.(2a)/Th'Emperour, I understond, is still at Wormes, and draweth to no through agrement with the Protestantes, (3a) by reasone of the develisshe suggestion of the great and abhominable harlett of Babylon, and dayly feding of him and his papysticall prelates with great abundaunce of extorcioned Romisshe ducates, as I heare of honnest men that come last from Andwarpe, so that the subjectes of that countreth do not shrinke to speke therof openly. The lyving Lorde transforme him into a more Christian mynde when His godly pleasur is, that His onely glory may be more generally sought for than it nowe manny yeires past haeth bene./On other side, our newes have ben almost all this weke past that xxx or xl M. Freasshemen ar come to besiege Boullen, and indede all is no fable, for ther is encamped beyond the water (wher Monsieur de Bies and his compaigny was raysed by th'Yrle of Hartford) by a nier estimacion (as I do credibly heare) aboute half the nombre abovesaid. Some other report that a lyke nombre, or somewhat fewer, is approched unto the place wher the Maister of the Hoerse(1b) was encamped when the King our maister besieged the towne, but I will not write that for so certain as th'other, I heare also that our men do dyvers tymes skermyche with them. (2b)/Newes from the see I heare none as yett that be certain, butt it wil not be long yer anny will com/e/, for the Kinge's Majestie is perfaictly informed that the 5th day of this monneth, all the Frensshe navie shuld be in redines to starte abrode. I suppose all shal not eskape our Englisshe navie, the good Lorde's will be done in everything and place, for the Counsaile of this reaulme do gyve men moche warening of Flanders, as well as thay do provide against Frensshemen. (3b)/Concerning the performance of thinges in your lettre aforemencioned, I have alredy done, and am redy to the rest when Mr. Cave will appointe carryage for his wine, and also Mr. Thomas Cave's mamsey. Sturgeon I have delyvered to my maister, but quayles cannot be hadde: my sayd maister doeth thanke Mr. Cave veray moche, and haeth straytly comanded me to write for none to Calleis./Briskette's howndes come nott hiether as yett, therfor appointe the sending up of them nowe while you ar at Tykeford yourself, or ellis he shal be deceyved as he haeth hietherto ben. Your bookes and writinges shal be sent you by this berar Sir Evank, if his maistershippe will take paynes to carry them well, for at the writing hierof I was uncertain of his pleasur./A like gentilman unto this, the first lettre of whos name is Nicolas Walker, is come to London, and yesterday putt up a supplication agenst you unto my Lord Chauncelour, (1c) Mr. Croke your oncle beyng retayned of his counsaile, but he not beyng ware that you wer anny partie of the same./For the crafty childe Nicol Walke-a-Knave haeth left owte of the said supplicacion your dwelling at Glapthorne, your beyng a gentilman, marchant, fermer or howseboundeman of the countre, and sayeth singly, one John Johnsone, of no place, facultie, nor occupation; but a man that is ryche and greatly frended haeth done and doeth great wrong aboute the ferme of the parsonage of Cotterstoke (not ones namyng Glapthorne) unto one A. B. C. (for I knowe not his name) nowe parsone of the same and successour to Edward Artewyke, clarke, etc., requiring processe against you in the Chancery (for that he is not able to contend with you at the comen lawe) and also against Artewyke, for to cause him to appier and to be examined, and sworne uppon certain articles that he haeth devised interrogatoryes for, etc.; which Artewyke haeth alredy ben examined uppon the same by Mr. Crooke, and his examinacion putt in writing befor that I hadde knowledge of any part of the mater. (2c)/Wheruppon yesterday after dyner I repayred to the foresaid Mr. Crooke with Artewyke, and declaired unto him you to be party, and that the mater was in Mr. Thomas Brudenelle's and Mr. Edward Griffyn's haundes to determyne, supposing them to have ended the same by this day, which end (perchaunce) the gentilman Walker not lykyng, or he beyng th'occasion and lett of the none determinacion, prively and craftely, withoute your knowledge, haeth putt fourth this mater into the Chauncery by a veray wrong informacion and a false surmyse, I instantyng him therfor to be as favorable in the mater as reasone, conscience, and justice do require: which wordes the said Mr. Crooke hearing, was veray sorry that he was of consaile agenst you; howbeit, thus moche perceiving as is afore rehersed, he fasthfully promised to be a staye that the matter shall have no redier dispatche agenst your proffite than if (in a manner) it ha/dde/ not ben notefyed to my Lord, untill (at leest) that you may have sufficient tyme to cause the gentilmen aforenamed to end the ma/t/er in the countre withoute anny further trouble, and therunto he will procure my said Lorde's injunction to Walker (if he can) to buysy himself no more with the mater untill it may be certefyed my Lord what the forenamed gentilmen can do therin./With which aunswer of Mr. Crooke's I hilde myself content, and Mr. Artewyke was shewed that he shuld nede no more to be spoken with aboute the same. The copye of the supplicacion I have not nor did not require the same as yet, having so good aunswer of Mr. Crooke in your favour, but I thinke it may be hadde when you will. It shal be good for you in myn opinion, to write unto Mr. Crooke what Mr. Brudenell and Mr. Griffin have done in the mater sins your last ryding home, or what is the lett of thayer none agrement, and I will send you his aunswer therunto.//rest missing/./	sara	60af9ecbf038043336624b26	Johnson & Company	xx-xx-1518	Otwell	Male	Johnson		Protestant	Merchant; draper of London	sara		60af9ecbf038043336624b28	Johnson & Company	xx-xx-1514	John	Male	Johnson		Protestant	Merchant; draper and stapler	sara

OTWELL JOHNSON TO JOHN JOHNSON//At London, the llth day in November, 1545//After my veray harty comendacions, brother, and trusting that you ar in helth, this shal be to certefie you that yesterday by Mr. Love's servaunt of the Staple, I receyved your lettre of the 3de of this present, with another from my cosin Ambrose, (1a) and therin Maistres Baynam's to Mr. Comptroller my maister, (2a) which I have none aunswer unto as yett, butt will procure the same as oportunitie shall serve. His sayng was to me after the reding of the lettre, that he thought his writing to the Counsaile of Calleis, agenst the Cleveners' obstinacye in that thay wil not pay your newe gossep, John Crante's wedowe, that was due to her howsebound by them, will litell prevayle, bycause he knowith them to be lawelesse gentilmen; but he thinketh some other way better, which I will gladly putt him in remembrance (as tyme may serve) to sett foreward./Your comsunicacion hadd with Mr. Appenrith in my behalf I do nott mislyke, but forsomoche as your advertisement therof haeth tarryed so long, and in consideracion of other mater contained in my late lettres sent to you per John Holland, (3a) I have not spared to shippe the packe of cloeth into Thomas Guyllem's shippe, and also have veray lergely and gentilly writton unto the foresaid Mr. Appenrith, so that my trust is that other he haeth sayed more to youtherin, or you to him, befor this lettre can come to your haundes wherof I wold be gladd to heare, when occasion shall serve you./In my former lettres aforemencioned, and in other sins with the particulers of your shipping (4a) which I doubt come somewhat late to your haundes), I did certefye you at large of all your buysines than knowen. Butt sins that tyme, vic't on Monday last, my Lord Chancelour himself made a decre agenst you in your parsonage mater, which Mr. Walke-a-knave (1b) carryed downe into the countre yesterday with spede, I am informed, and ther will putt the parson (2b) in possession of all thinges that belong therunto, with no small bragge I am sure. To declaire the circumstaunce of the ordering of this mater, nether tyme nor paper doeth serve me nowe./The trueth is, that the manner of suche a decre-making haeth not ben knowen, seen, nor hard of befor; that is, th'one partie onely spoken with by my said Lord, and th'other never called therunto, nor anny day geven for the hearing therof, or to make proves; butt my Lord, being throughly and prively incensed by Mr. Griffin, veray sodenly and in a day (in a manner) extraordinary, prononced the decre aforesaid; Mr. Croke, Mr. Sergeaunt, (3b) nor none other of your counsaile being harde speke therin, but rather comanded to silence, and the decre being redy drawen befor my Lord sitting downe in Westmynster Hall. This judgement is to be taken in wourth at my Lorde's haundes, for it can in nowise nowe be chaunged. Your recoverye of all together is to be sought by the lawe from Artewyke, for he is the grownd of all this confusion; but he is like to be used accordingly (perchance) shortly. In my next lettre you shal be certefyed mor particularly hierof, and of our proceding with Artewyke./Hierwith I send you a lettre from Mr. Cave, (4b) and another from my syster your wiff. (5b) I thinke the same containe moche mater of displeasur agenst me, for therwith I hadde one from her myself, not so gentilly writton as she was wonte to do. The mater is for that I writt unto her that I hadde no remembrance of you, nor writing also, to send her anny monney nowe lately for Haryson. Also uppon the like occasion the said Harrysone haeth writton rasshely unto me, that I shuld take no care of anny monney that is sent or delyvered unto him, for he knowith me for no owner therof./I pray you aunswer them boeth for me, for I wil not.

OTWELL JOHNSON TO JOHN JOHNSON//At London, the 18th day in Novembre, 1545//After my harty comendacions, brother, to all our frendes in Calleis, this shall lett you to understond that even as I was aboute to aunswer your lettres of the 8th and 10th of this monneth, other ij of the 14th and 15th come to my haundes; perceyving by the former of the two last, your paynes-taking and conclusion made with Bartolmewe Warner, for the which I moost hartely thanke you, and am veray well contented with that you have done, trusting to fynd him no lesse my frend than he hasth promised you that he wil be, the lyving Lord prospering his affaires; and for anny proceding betwen her (1a) and me, other to take her from Richardsone's, or for appointing the tyme or place of marryage, I will differre it untill Bartholmewe's coming over or youres, putting you owte of doubt that our consentes shall not disagre to boeth your orderinges of everything, by Gode's grace./Nowe for aunswering of your former lettres, you shall understond that I can make butt small sale of your wullis, at the prices that you have left me, as yett: what I shall do hierafter I am ignoraunt. I doubt it wil be long, first for so manny as have hietherto bought anny therof by your said prices, come not agen, but go to other men and ar better spedde bylyke. Indede, Mr. Cave's people do serve men of veray honnest geare for 13s 8d, and thay have sold within this 3 wekes about vij or Viij^xx todde, for ready monney all, as I am informed. Moche of his middell Barkes doeth runne emonges his darke clifte wull and refuse, as I myself haeth seen it and Mr. Haynes haeth shewed me so, which the cloethyars lyke well, and can do themselves more good therwith than with youres; for all your middell clifte and refuse is pyled (as you knowe) emonges your clifte wull onely, which Mr. Haynes thinkes to be bare ynough of itself withowte adding of anny more middell and refuse to it, which shuld come owte of the serplers of clifte wull that you wold have him to packe into pockettes; and the pile of lokke wull by th'other side wil not be sold for 16s at no haunde (as yett) as it is, and therfor Mr. Haynes doeth not intend to drawe the good wull from it, nor thinketh good to put mor middell unto it, to be taken owte of the serplers of end wull that you wold have lykewise packed into pockettes, in case vou will kepe your price therof so high as you write of. And indede ther is no rome in the wullhowse to packe one pokett nother of end nor clifte: ft is paystred with serplers allredy, and yett ther is ij lode more to come, as I understond. Ther is skauntly rome for the skaelles, and but a strayte way to the clifte pile to fett wull unto them, for serplers stonde in boeth th'endes of the howse; for ther was no more wull piled up sins your departing than was befor, nor cannot yett, if anny shuld be packed in pokettes./I could (perchaunce) sell all your Cottes wull, good and middell (as I thinke) to straungers hier, if you wold be content to have the same short from th'other end woull, for I have ben spoken unto for the same, and was offered xvj marke and 0.25 for a sakke, not expressing indede as moche middell as A. (howebeit I suppose it wold be so), and all redy monney. Yf you will have me to procede therin, make me spedy aunswer hierunto, and I will do what I can. Cloethyars surely will never come to your price of yt as it is nowe, for that thay cannot be able to wourke it to a grot proffite in a sacke, which is a pitefull case, and therfor truely I thinke manny of them will leave making of cloeth for this yeir, as in veray dede dyvers Kentisshemen do cesse alredy, for never a weke sins Mychelmas last thay haeth brought half so manny cloethes, as marchantes and retailers have ben gredy to snatche up. I cannot fasten uppon anny of them to bargain with for xl, lx, or jC todde of wull, above xiijs a todde, of your pile of clifte wull as it is nowe, or ijd or a grote more wil be th'uttermoost that anny of them will come unto, and than take but vj or vilj todde to prove it; but after the prove I have not seen them retourne. I have sold none as yett sins your departing under 13s 6d, and wold be as glad as yourself (and so I trust you thinke of me) to continue the sams, orirather to ryse, if it could be gotten. Butt by my conscience it is to moche, and alas, power men must have some lyving! And albeit that I knowe it stondeth you moche derer than the last yeir, and that our chargis ar great (and therunto your gaynes wold be proporcioned), yett truely men wil not do butt as thay may lyve, as reasone is, and so you shall be fayne to tarry the lenger from sale, in doyng wherof, I cannot say but that you may chaunce to gett your owne price, and so (of a lykelyhode) sell your ware and your marchant together. Notwithstonding, in the measne seasone you may consider howe all our buysines ar to be compassed, and on my behalf (as I have ben ever redy therunto) I will right gladly and diligently followe your mynd in every condicion, having nowe a respect to the relenting of your prices contained in your latter lettres, and to the nede that you write you shall shortely have of monney, yf by anny mesnes cloethyars wil be brought to our passe befor Christmas./John Baseden haeth ben with me twys or thrys sins your going over, but he will in nowise medle with the serpler of wull that you offered him, above a marke a todde, nor with none of the clifte wull pile, and yett cannot pay for all untill aboute Candelmas next. At his next coming to towne (which wil be xiiij dayes hens) I will bargain with him if you thinke good, for the man is honnest and sure and haeth not hietherto broken day, and therfor it is not good losing of suche customers, which also wil not chaunge with his goodwill. Patenden, Sugar, Hoeth and other of the last yeir wil not, nor (thay say) thay cannot, medle with me at the prices that I have holden to them hietherto this yeir./Touching Mr. Appenrith, I trust that other he of his owne mynd haeth aunswered my lettre by mought unto you, or ellis you have found some honnest oportunitie by this tyme to have comuned with him for me. Yf not, I referre the matter holly to your discrecion, not doubting but to heare from you therof shortely after that annything is determined betwen you. I trust my gentilnes will please him well, and the promis that I make to be at his comandement hierafter, as I have ben hiertofore at his sone's. (1c)/Wher you note unto me our determinacion of proffite for disboursing of monney aboute your affaires, I trust you did understond my writing that I shuld not estime my doing to moche, but that therby I ment onely the declaracion of the small store of monney that I hadde by me to furnisshe my syster your wyffe's request that she sent unto me for sodenly, and ellis nothing; for wold to Our Lord that I hadde so moche mony of myn owne as wold serve your pourpos continually, withoute taking anny by exchaunge, and than you might be assured therof withoute anny reproche. And as for my syster's writing agenst me (if any suche be), it maketh no mater, for I do regard the seme as you will me to do by your last lettre, vic't. proceding from a woman; Nevertheless, her excuse to you of her displeasur, for my refusing to send her reed win, is also lyke a woman's tale, for I hadde no way to do it than but to have sent some in a bottell by Richard Preston when he was hier. Well, she shall not be long withoute some, if that be all the cause of her grieff! Better a badde excuse than none! I wil not aunswer her rasshely, nor Mr. Harryson nother, but be content that thay take their pleasur with me, and so continue in supporting your affaires as you do myn, with right goodwill, God to frend./For the decre agenst you in the Chauncery, no remedy can be devised but to sue Artewyke for the recovery of your fyne to him geven, and your costes; for the proceding wherin, my cosin Bretain haeth gotten a writt of latitat owte of the Kinge's Benche, which shal be served on him as shortly as may be, and you shall knowe what shall followe./It haeth pleased God this day to take Henry Johnsone, my boy, from me by death, and doubting whether it be the plage or not, I am resorted to my brother Gery's howse, and ther will continue this xiiij dayes at leest. I pray you, lett Thomas Barwell my frend be secretly certefyed therof, to th'end he make not his wiff pryvey of the same to rasshely. You may shewe him it was of the plage, bycause ellis he or his wiff (perchaunce) wold thinke that he wer cast away for lakking of loking unto, which I take God to judge was not so, for he dyed in myne armes, Our Lord have his sowle and all Christen, and kepe you in helth.

OTWELL JOHNSON TO JOHN JOHNSON//At London, the 28th in Novembre, 1545//With my harty comendacions, brother, this shall lett you to witt that in my former lettres I forgatt to advertise you of 40li st. receyved by exchaunge of Nicolas Bacon, mercer, for double usance at 26s, paieable the 20th in January, and my billis made the 16th or this monneth and directed to Robert Tempest, which 40li was to furnisshe up Mr. Tanfelde's monney. Sins that tyme, and also sins my last writing, I have paid your bill of 60li st. to Mr. Judde, alderman, wherof Mr. Smyth furnissned 40li,and I,20li, withoute taking of anny by exchaunge. At the payement of Mr. James Gage for the Kinge's sommer fellis (which must nedes be this next weke coming) I doubt I must charge you by the said exchaunge for the same, and I thinke the some will be more than you left me remembraunce of, for Mr. Gage aforenamed shewed me yesterday a bill that Mr. Cofferar (1a) hadde gyven him to aske him the monney by, cont. 102li 18s 10d, but therin was the shorlinges. What the just some wil be I cannot yett certefie you. When I knowe, it shal be paid, and you shortely after advertised therof./Monney commeth in veray slakely as yett for wullis, but yesterday I bargained with a couple of Suffocke men for 80 todde of the clifte wull, to be receyved befor Christmas (and at the weight to have redy mony) after a marke a todde, and somewhat over in thole. I am jobbing nowe and than with 6, 8, or 1O todde at ones, for 13s 6d or theraboute of clifte, and 8 or 12 todde of th'end wull I have sold for 16s; but Mr. Cave and other men dispatche hole serplers in a weke, which men like better for tnayer prices bylyke than thay do youres. The tyme will come, I suppose, that youres will away faster, but it shal be (perchaunce) when thay have done that sell nowe so fast./From Mr. Appenrith I have receyved this weke a veray gentill and thankeful lettre (which I will aunswer shortely), and therin he promiseth me that I shal be no loser by him./It shal not be nedefull therfor that you talke anny more with him for me, I thanke you, for that you have done./To my cosin George Haster, I pray you comend me, and desire him to gett me my sylver taster of Thomas Appenrithe's wedowe, (1b) which I desired him to do at his last being hier, and bring the same over with you, and also a Frenshe gymplett, I pray you.

OTWELL JOHNSON TO JOHN JOHNSON//At London, the 9th in January, 1544.//In my right harty manner I recomend me unto you, and to my very good syster your wiff, with all my good cosins at Sybbertofte, and elliswhersoever you be, rendring infinite thankes to you all, boeth for my good chier in the countre and also other kindnes./Sir, after my coming to this Cite, I did resorte unto Maistres Fayrey to gyve her your comendacions, and after long comunicacion (as her custome is) she desired me to send you word that her mynd is to have ij serplers of wull more, than for her 3001i that you have imployed alredy, and thay shall be to furnisshe up her full some abovesaid to her Staple occupyeng; for the ij serplers of clifte wull which she willed you to send up shortely, shal be for to make sale of owte of haund at her howse hier in London, to cloethyars or other./Nowe Sir, she doeth referre the sorte of the ij serplers that ar to buy, unto your discretion; that is, to have them of that sorte as may have redyest dispatche in the Staple. Howbeit, if she shuld use her will in the buyng of them, she wolld have them good Cottes and good Barkes, withoute middell wull, and so she sayeth that she willed Anthony her sone (1a) to write unto you in his last lettre, which Mr. Smyth hadde sent unto you to Tykeford by Grene (as he shewed me) befor my coming home, or ellis I wold have sent it you with this, and therfor nowe I do write thus largely of that mater./Moreover Sir, she willed me to certefye you that ther is a stranger in this Cite that haeth comission to buy wull for a 1,000li st. of good Cottes and good Barkes, 2 of the first and one of the secound, withoute anny middell wulles. He wold make the bargain betwext this and Candelmas, gyve good ernest, and receyve the wulles after Easter at Calleis.His price she knowith not, but Anthony her sone shewed me that he asked what his mother wold bate of 37li, and sayeth that she shall have preferrement of 500 poundes' wourth, if she and her frendes can make so moche of those sortes redy for the pourpos. Wherfor your advise and helpe is very moche required in this behalf, and namely to advertise Maistres Fayrey with spede whether you will take any part of the bargain with her, and also (as nigh as may be) to write unto her for what some of money she shall have of the foresaid two good sortes, for she intendes to be doyng with this straunger for all her said fyne wulles if she like his price./For other maters of hers, understond that she thinketh your clifte wull to dier at 14 gr. and 14 and 1d, for she is accustumed to have it hier delyvered for 9s, as she sayeth, and furthermore, she wold knowe the names and be acquainted with your gatherers of wulles, with suchelike toyes a great manny. Make aunswer as you thinke good, for I have sayed litell to her of them./Hierinclosed I send you Mr. Smythe's bill, of the copye your reconing, and the rest of the monney he will delyver to me tomorrowe or the next day./I was promised monney for your battery (1b) yesterday at the Court of my maister, (2b) some day the next weke,after the Kinge's coming to Westminster Manner, which is appointed to be on Satterday next. Howbeit, I have no mencion in your bill of the chargis of the said battery, as freight, custome and other thinges; send me word therof by your next writing therfor./Mr. Wilkes delyvered my man butt 54s 6d st. yesterday at my beyng at the Court, for your bill of reconing, and saye[th] you ought him the rest; howbeit I gave my knave charge to rec[ve] all the monney or ellis none,- butt as he doeth all thinges ellis, so haeth he done in this./Notwithstonding, I will send him to Wilkes agen with the monney incontinent after the writing hierof, for to fett all or ellis the bill agen; for I myself wold not go to receyve the monney for doubt of suchelike buysines. By the next I will send you word howe I spede with him for the same, and of other thinges./Mr. Robins sent you a lettre aboute 10 or 12 dayes before Christemas, and it was delyvered to Raeff Freman of Northampton to carry unto you by Thomas Smyth, which did require aunswer. He wold gladdly heare somewhat from you therof./Your piese of woursted haeth beyn coming from Calleis with geare of Richard Whettelle's, as I am informed, almoost this moneth. When it cometh, it shal be sent as shortely as may be./For newes, I send you hierwith thelast proclamacion of the restrainct of Frensshes wares.

Sins my said Lorde's coming from the Court, nothing can be spoken of almost, but diligence with the commissions to be sent abrode for the subsedy, which for the moost part passe through Mr. Crooke's haundes, (1a) and therfor moost tymes of my reporting unto him, he is at small lesur to attend uppon my comunicacion; and for that cause I made him a mynute in writing of thole circumstaunce of your mater, to carry aboute with him and to looke theron, whensoever he can gett any spare tyme; and therwithall I will and am appointed this day to repayre agen unto him, to rememorate the thing unto him. More attendaunce can I nor no man ellis gyve, I thinke, and also Mr. Crooke's promisses ar large, so that I trust you shall take no further domaige in the mater, whatsoever other recompense may be obtayned for you./With Maistres Fayrey I can do nothing other than I wrote you the last weke, and therfor Mr. Haynes is a-packing of your wullis into pokettes, and haeth alredy shott over the pyle of end wull that you se, but is not yett come to the serplers. Owte of the said pile is packed 15 or 16 pokettes midell Cottes; the rest, being in estimacion 7 or 8 pokettes, is good wull, which he will try this day asondre and packe them up als/o/, and so procede according to your mynd. He haeth found 12 or 13 todde not wourthy of the lokk (as he sayeth) and therfor it shal be layed by itself, for you to loke on at your coming up, if you will have it so kepte. At the delyverance of your abstract of Maistres Fayre's reconinges to her, she shewed me Anthony White her sone's accompt last delyvered to her, and therin he chargeth you with 660li st.at this present, wheras the foet of your accompt abovesaid doeth mencion her rest to be but 118li st. and odde monney, besides the 500li for this yeire's imployment; wheruppon I shewed her that you wer able and will at all tymes defend the perfection of your accomptes, to Anthony White's contradiction or any man's ellis, and therwith she, being content, required me to take paines in your absence, to accord the same your abstract with Anthony's decl/a/racion befor her in his presens, if it could be don, wherby she shuld not be to moche deceyved of him; which thing I have promised her to do at her pleasur. But yett for all that she wold relent nothing of her proffite of 10011, for th'imployement of her 500li abovesaid./Concerning my coming downe unto you with Maria my woman shal be, by the Lorde's appointement and favor, it is so that her brother Bartolmewe our frend is come over 3 or 4 dayes past, and not being yett discharged of his accomptes, his retourne to Calleis agen (to cleare the same with the auditoures that ar ther in comtssion) must of force be so spedy and (perchaunce ) soudain, that he can in nowise attempt to ryde towardes you, in his syster's compaigny and myn; and yett notwithstonding, he is so veray ernestly desirous to se the solempnisacion of our matrimony celebrated while he may be at this side the see, that all measnes possible he will devise to stay his retourne abovesa/id/ thies 10 or 12 dayes next coming, and theruppon haeth effectually /desi/red me to lett you have knowledge by this my writing of his fervent desire abovespecified, and his urgent lett of his coming downs unto your howse, and so consequently to declaire unto you, that we wold /be/ gladde to end the solempnisacion abovesaid hier in London befor his foresaid retourne to Calleis agen, if the same be not alltogether agenst your mynd, the chargis of which celebracion he doeth gentilly offer to beare himself holy, boeth of her rayement and feasting, which shal be as moderate as may become our honnesties, by Gode's grace./May it therfor please you, gentill brother (as veray hartely I besieche you) to take paynes to repayre hiether yourself, and my syster yourwiff (if she can quietly attempt to travaile so farr) aboute th'end of the next weke, and than we wold procede to our doinges on Monday befor Candelmas day, which shal be the 25 of this present, for longer then that day it cannot be diffirred, to performe Bartolmewe's mynd at leest. (1c) I trust you have made no great preparacion for my coming unto you aboute this buysines, howbeit I am throughly perswaded of your gentill affection towardes me, and the like thing I do experiment in our frend abovenamed, wherfor I can be content (as alway I have ben, and God willing so will continue) to subjecte myself to boeth your willes, vic't. to marry hier first for his pleasur, and than to come downe to you and mary ther agen (if you thinke it good) for your pleasur./Thus Sir, eftsones I desire you to take this our appointement to no displeasur, /but/ be so good as to prepare hietherward yourself agenst the tyme abovsaid, /or/ ellis within a day after this shall come to your haundes to send me up direct word of your mynd by one of your owne servauntes, if you may spare anny, or by same other suer measnes: for albeit that I knowe your discrecion to be suche as that you wold not have me so addicte to your private affection or appointement, but that I may frely use my libertie in proceding to this thing, as to other, yett boeth Bartolmewe our frende's advise is, and also my fantasye agreeth therunto, to certefie /you/ largely hierof, and to require your willing repayer hiether, or at leest your consent that we procede as is abovespecified in your absence./Hierwith, brother, I do send you a warrant for a doo, to be served at Higham Ferries. If it please you to send your man or Christofer Desborrowe thiether, to have it served ther befor your coming or sending your aunswer hierunto, it wold /do/ me moche pleasur and honnestie, and I will gladly bere all the chargis of the same; or ellis, if your oportunitie will not serve to gett the same nows served, devise some other compstent tyme for it, for I wold be loeth to have it made voyed./Mr. Lighe haeth hadde no aunswer from Peter Bate sins Christmas (as he shewed me at the writing hierof), and therfor can send you none other worde of your mater whith him, than he lytt you knowe at your being hier with him./I take no fruyt at his wordes that you ar like to attain to your request./William Gifford is not in London at this present, butt is loked for dayly.

(2d)/With John Lewesone I have had comunicacion for the Marche wull that he haeth at Calleis to sell, according to your lettre befor your coming over, butt he will make you no promise of them untill his being ther, for to lerne how the prices go of suche sortes: sand that lerned, if you wer ther, he wold make you a more reasonable price of them than anny man of your Compaigny, but he cannot like myn offer that you will me by your lettre to make, by xls in a serpler as it shuld seame, saying also that 9 pokettes of his good wull ar old. I have writton hierof to Henry Suthwyke, and so may you do more at large, when you thinke it requisite./For newes, we understond that our Boullen men had a veray great and shamefull foyle of the Frenshemen on Twelf day last or the morening following, so that the talking is that your Mr. Vyat, Sir George Pollard, and manny of the best captens ther shuld be slayne, and likewise the chieff of the best Italians and Arbennoys ar dispatched, which is one of the greatest losse that come to Boullen sins it was gotten.

Your Lettre by the same Clement I have also receavid, and do well perseave your mynd therin./For aunswer, it maye lyke you to understond that before the recept of your letter I agreid with Rose's wedowe, in the presens of her oncle Stephen Marton, that she shuld have vjli for a C somers, and iiijli xvs tor a C of winters, for all that she shuld have this next yeare, accordyng wherunto I made indentures betwene her and you, and her oncle at his returne owt of the countrey will seall an obligacion, wherin she and he shal be bound even as Rose was the last yeare; and bycause they wold not consent to buy anny bochers above thos percelles that we do allowe her, I promysed by worde of mouthe that whatsoever they shuld paye above tne prices abovesaid to anny bocher, so it wer by our consentes, that we woold allowe them, thoughe ther be no mencion made in th'endentures; and otherwyse I cowld not agrey, for thoughe Otes dyd sell under the price he bought, I cannot perceave other will, for all the rest of ther wares be raysed so highe that they have nothing to proffit in but only the taylles and wombes that they cut of. As yeat she is sewer of no more bochers then Cheschir and her oncle. Now that she is cherged, she will abrod and do what maye be done, and I will leave soche order with my brother (2a) and Mr. Smyth that none shal be refewsid that maye reasonable be obtayned./Mr. Skreven's felmonger is not for you; his gethering is but in the cuntrey. Yf anny other maye be had, ther shal be profit mad. Mr. Comptroller (1b) hathe but moved for to be mean ye may have the Kynge's fell still, which he hathe promysed to do. Mr. James Gage is in Sussex, and therfore I will leave order with my brother for geving Mr. James Gage his reward, and also to paye for the Kynge's winters; and further he hath promised that he wil be dilygent about the procurement of the having of the Kynges fellis this next yeare, not mistrustyng but it wil be brought wel ynoghe to pas./Althoughe the prices of fellis be veray dere in the countrey and here also, I do mistrust that we shal not bryng our winter Londons above xvj nobles at Callais at this time, for seing they bought generally ther for xiij nobles di. the C last yeare, it wil be hard nowe to bryng them above xvj nobles. I denye not but in th'end of the yeare, or the next yeare, they maye be so sold, but it wer better sell for xvj in the begining, considring the losse of tyme: for nowe that it is enactid at Callais that all new shorne wullis under fyne Limster, fyne Matchen, fyne Cottes, and fyne Berkes maye be shipped for this ij yeres, notwithstondyng anny ordinaunce before made, and that for a more preferment to the Lawe Contrey wullis we have here agreid that, yf the Companey at Callats wyll so agrey also, that soch sortes of wull shall issewe /with/owt anny beneyfite, it shal be more profit for you and me to take the lesse gaigne in our fellis, and employe it in wullis agaynst the next shipping, whereof by Goode's grace we maye have returne agayne, to serve to provid us bothe wull and fell agaynst the next shipping after that; and therfore write your minde further in this matter, I prey you./Thomas Love's bill and John Calthrope's I have sent to Robert Andrew at Andwerp,(2b) bycause of Robert Tempeste's comyng thens, and as I wold do for myself yf I were in case lick. As yet ther is no aunswer commen from Thomas Love: what he meaneth I cannot tell. Mr. Smythe shall put hym in remembrans with another lettre as sone as a messinger can be hard of./I am now agreid with Rychard Whethill for Cli at xxvs, paieable the  xx of this moneth, and jCli st. more that ye write of I will also provid for you beffore my goyng hens, whiche I entend not shal be before th'end of this weke, for our shippes wer yesterdaye at Gravisend, so that I feare me they shal not be at Callays this spring./I shall appoynt the pay/ment/ befor Palme Sondaye (1c) of ijCli to Mr. Willin's clerke, and desier Mr. Assheley to get youe as Long tyme tor the rest as he can. Mr. Assheley showed me that he had gotten a graunt for xilij dayes after Easter, but he makythe no dowte to get it lenger. As we do therin, ye shal be sertyfied./Your parte of the monney paid Rose's wif amounteth to 68li 28 11.5d, and to Chester some 98li 2s 11d, wherof ye must be allowid 48li 12s 0d for rest or reconyng made at Tickford, and for that paid for shorlinges 12li 16s 0d, some 61li 8s 0d. So restes to me 36li 14s 11d, and therbie ye maie perseave that xlli will not clere Mr. James Gage's reward and all; nevertheles, the best I can I will apointe the furnysshing of all your busynes, and at leestwise I will leave order for it./Your monney in the Mynte is not yet receyved; this weke my brother trustes to have it. As sone as he can have it, it shal be deliveryd Thomas Smythe./For to get monney for your debenter for cattell can be no more done then is, and therfore ther is no remedy but tarie the tyme./And for the paiement of your custome and other charges at Calles, if ther comme not monney of our goodes ner of your rest in Flaunders, I shall make provision for you as I do for myself, wherof and of all thinges ellis nedefull, ye shall be (by Gode's grace) from tyme to tyme sertyfied./Mistris Dacres rode home to Cheston on Saterdaie, and Mr. Bromley is not in case to ryde, and therfore methincke it were best for you to send my brother Rychard (2c) to her when he cometh up next. When he is at Baernet, he shall not have past iiij or v myles thether, for it is within ij myles of Wallam. Yf ye write to her and desier her that my brother may serche owt these peses of evedences /t/hat shall serve you, and to leave them with her untyll she have showed them unto some of here lerned counsaill, I thincke she wil not refewse it, and so by that means ye shall have leest t/rowble/ in apointing of anny other to go thether./In the sales of your wullis I can do you no pleasure, for I have x_sacke myself yet to sell. The sales be sore slacked he/r/, and that I trust wyll amend the prices in the countre.	sara	60af9ecbf038043336624b28	Johnson & Company	xx-xx-1514	John	Male	Johnson		Protestant	Merchant; draper and stapler	sara		60ed97bf55947e60cc7375ed			Anthony	Male	Cave		Protestant	Draper and merchant of the Staple in Buckinghamshire; friend of John's father; John was apprenticed to him	sara

At Bruges in 1565, doubtless following the practice at Calais, it was laid down that past and present Mayors of the Staple might ship a maximum of 60 sarplers of wool a nd fells a year; Lieutenants were allowed to ship 50 sarplers a year, and Constables 40 sarplers a year. Married staplers (such as John Johnson in 1546) were allowed to ship 35 sarplers a year. Staplers\' widows (like Mrs. Fayrey and Mrs. Baynham) were allowed to ship 35 sarplers a year. Bachelors were permitted to ship 20 sarplers a year, and apprentices who were free Of the Staple were allowed to ship 4 sarplers a year? with their master\'s consent, after they had served six years of their apprenticeship. The penalty for exceeding the stint was £5 on every excess sarpler.

JOHN JOHNSON TO ANTHONY CAVE//To Mr. Anthony Cave/at London, per/Henry Sowthwicke./Jhesus anno 1546, the vth daie of Maie, at Callais//After dew comendations unto you and my awnte, trustinge of your helthe, etc., this maie be to signifie unto you that sins my brother's (1a) comyne hether I receavid no lettre frome you, but I sent you one writton on Easter Even. (2a) I have sins sold to Daniell vand Heede j pockett of fynne Cottes and iiij pockett fyne yong Cottes, free owt at full price, to be paid di. in the paiementes of this marte, and th'other di. in the Sinxon maerte. The rest of your wull I trust wil be uttered shortely, but yet I cowld mete with no marchauntes mete for it./I have also sold all the rest ot your fellis, to wit, unto Anthony Franzon and Martin Johnson of Leithe, the sommers at xix nobles the C and the wyntters at xv nobles di. the houndreth, and apon the hole bargayne I have vjli st. more at all, so that considering I make nygne xiiijC sommers fellis, I exteme I lacke not moche of xv nobles iij quarters for our winter felles. I must have all redie monney heir and at Andwerp, saving Cli st. in the Bames marte. The daie is set: 15 of December. Althoughe this be under the price ye apointyd, yet I trust ye wil be content, tor it is to trewe that no man hath sold above xv nobles di., and yet forbeare of ther monney as I do. I thincke not but ye shuld have made xvj nobles of them, but then we must have lenger then perchaunce ye do reken./I wrote to Mr. Smythe (1b) to take up monney at London of the Kynge's monney, which I perceavid wold be deliverid after xxvs the pounde, to be paide in the Pasche and Sinxon maertes, but I have not perfaict aunsweer therof as yet; but if it maie so be had, I wyllyd hym to take viijCli st. for you and me, and I wold paie ijCli in haund, iijCli in the Pasche marte, and iijCli in the Sinxon maerte. (2b)/Because hier is no sterlinge monney to be had of the Hollanders but to losse, for they wold paie th'angle for xs iiijd Fl., I have taken up hier as more monney as will paie your custome, wiche I will chearge Thomas Smyth to paie at London.

When we camme to th'examynation of the matter, they aunsweryd as thought all thinges had been clere, but we still mystrustyng the matter maide triall, and fownd that for xij serplers fyne Cottes wull that Dylhornne had sold of his marke, the spetiallties were made in Thomas Offley's name; apon which presumption and other cawses of suspetion, we perusyd ther aunswer unto th'articles, and fownd thate all they agreyd that the wull was bought and solde bitwene them for xxij marke the sacke, to paie di. at Mydsomer, rest at Mychelmes; and when we consydryd that it stode them in Cxxxijli vjs viijd mer st. ix pockettes, we rekenyd they cowld not make ther monney agayne of yt at the full price of the Staple by a noble in iij serplers, thowghe they madde home ther monney at xxvs the pounde; and the trewthe is that they have solde but for xxxixli xs st. the serpler, and so they lose nyghe xls st. in iij serplers, so that it veary manifestely appered before us to be a collour, and that the suffrans therof myght be a mean to bring th'act to none effec. For if men may make soche collorable bargaynes with ther frendes, kynsmen and servaunttes as Mr. Offley hathe done with his kynsmen and servauntes, then shal it comme to pass that other which now ship but lx serplers (1c) wull under lyke collours ship above a C serplers wull in a yeare, and so bringe all into a few men's haundes; wherfore at a Court hier holden on Tuesdaie laste, the saide Thomas Offley for procuryng the collowr, and William Dylhorne and John Cotten for the suffering of it to be done in ther names, were crossyd the fredome according to th'ordynance, and shall not be reamytted again under ijc marke st. apese, as in the same ordynaunce at large is mentioned. (2c)/No/w/ Sir, we be infourmed that Mr. Offley is disposyd to trowble in this matter, for his brother (1d) sayd he wold spend ij M. li in the cawse, and bycause the Company wold not be troden underfote in the matter (the same standing as it were on the welthe of the Staple), they be determyned to stand stedfastly in the deffenes therof, and have devisyd a lettre unto Sir Raphe Warren, Mr. Judde and Master Medle, and requier thier helpes to make andswer if neade be; and another lettre shall come to you, Mr. Bury, and Master Chester, to desier you to assiste them, and that if Mr. Offley will stirre in the matter to Mr. (2d) to Master Baker, (3d) or anny of the Counsaille, as it is suspectyd he will, that ye will stand in the maintenunce therof and desier his frendship therin.

JOHN JOHNSON TO RICHARD JOHNSON///To Richard J/ohnson/at Ca/llais/, per/T/homas/ F/lecton/. (1a)/Jhesus anno 1547, the first day of Marche, at London.///B/rother,/I have me comendyd unto youe, and even so ye ar comendyd from my wif and all your freindes hier, prayinge you to have us comendyd to Mistres Baynam, my oncle and awnte, (2a) Mr. Helierd, and all our frendes with you, ete. Your lettre of the 28th of the last moneth I receyved this day, perseaving therby your safe arryvali at Calleis, etc./I do send you hierinclosed the billis of shipping of your master's (3a) wull and fellis, of my wullis shipping, and of Mistris Fayre's, wherbye ye shall perseave the nomber and sortes of eche, and therfore I omyt the declaracyon therof at this tyme./Ye shall perseave that the fellis ve all shipped in your master's name, howbeit the trewthe is it is our jonct goodes and our jonct adventure, and therfore ye must so declare it at Calleis in Courte or Assemble to th'end the same be not holy set on the reconnyng of your master's stynte, and also that no man take anny advauntage therof, as thoughe we should purpose to do contrary to the ordynaunce./The cawse that they were not entryd in bothe our names cometh by neclygens in entring in of the bill of report, as I take it, howbeit I hier saye it was the pointers' fault that forgott to entre them trewly. (5a) I purpose to declare the thing hier by my othe the next Assemble, which I will procure to be certyfied the sonest I can./The hole nombre of wullis now shipped is 1560 pockettes or therapon, and felles 49,600, which I thinke be all Londons, within ij M. or therapon./The Hollanders of Haerlem, I perseave, atend the fleat at Calleis /and/ purpose to prevent the Laithners. Yf they can bring their purpose to passe they do wysely: howbeit, I thinke the Leithners be as wyly as they. Ye had nede to consulte with soche of the Company as shall have the doinges of the fellis now shipped, and perswade the mater so that th'act which is made for the praisement of new fellis maye be at lybertie, for it is no tyme to bynd ourselves to soche inconvenyens, the prices of felles consydered hier in Englond; ond howe the Companye wil be indeferent in the praysing of other men's felles when they have sould their awne, it is moche to be dowted, for I have sene the lyke, and do perseave that many be of that sorte that when th/ey/ ha/ve/ ....................................................///large part missing///....................... /h/ave their ......... ....................... then they might ............... ........................... now when the hole ................... ................ /a/ttorneys in getting of ...... ..... a/nd t/hat the owners of the felles ha/ve no/ /a/dwauntage therbye, but the attorneys. The Hollanders c/om/playned by the lettres of this misuse, and when it was .............. by the Company that occupied felles, that the Hollaf/n/ders were more charged by theyr attorneis then nedyd, and that the rest of the Company that occupyed wull and no felles perseavid that their markettes were hyndered by soche means, they agreid that at anny tyme whensoever /a/ony of the Company wold hold his felles at anny exsessyve price, (which the attorneys used to do if the Hollonders would not buy wull and fell togethers) that the fellis should be praised, and at that tyme it was reasonable. But nowe, forasmoche as bothe wull and felles is scant and at great prices, and that no man nede now to covet to sell one thinge with another for anny advauntage (for all is worth full price and redye money, spetially clyft wull) yt is against reason that the former act should stond in strenghett, but that every man do his best advauntage, for ellis men shal not be encoraged to bring annythinge to the Staple; and therfore it is mete to forsee this thinge, that that act be dispencyd within time, before the Hollanders begynne buyng, ellis they shal be encoraged to take th'advantage therof uppon homesoever it shall happen./The prices of felles excede all reason (as ye knowe) and it is againste all reason that a man shal be compelled to sell better chepe then he can buy again. What if we bought better chepe then we can now do? Shall we therfore geve the profytt that should comme to us for disbursing our monney_to the Hollonders? I see no honeste reason for it. And t/her/fore the prices hier consydered, we cannot sell our felles /redie/ shipped under xviij nobles redie monney, or the moest parte redy monney, and to geve daie of xx or xlli a month or so. Accordyng whereunto use yourself, putting your diligens to perswade in manner afforesaid to bring us from bondage of th'act before-mentioned. Your master and I, perseving the great prices /o/ft felles in Englond (which is vijli xs somers, and vjli wyn/ters/ or more, yea and in the countre yet dearer, for they ... .................. /the/ houndreth) have determyned ............................ /un/der vjli st. ta. the C, more ............................... them /u/nder, to kepe them.

And so doinge you shall girde the Hollonders well inoughe, as moche to their displeasure as the taking of our felles against our willes. (1c)/Ther is shipped in all of myne 68 pockettes, of your master's 54 pockettes, and of Mistris Fayre's ix pockettes; and in felles of your master's and myne iiij M. iiij^xx fellis. Touching the sale of your master's wull I can write nothinge untyll the next weke that I knowe his mynd. My wull is of the soirtes folowinge, viz. 42 pockettes A. Kesten, 3 pockettes A.

The printed recantation of his views referred to by Otwell was evidently not considered sufficient, for on 15th May he preached at Paul\'s Cross (see Letter 499), declaring that the authority of the Bishop of Rome had been lawfully abolished. He repeated his recan- tation at Oxford in July, stating however that he merely retracted and did not recant.

OTWELL JOHNSON TO JOHN JOHNSON//At London, the 20th in June, 1547//After th'inclosing of my other hierwith bound (brother) I receyved youres per Mr. Bretain, and by the same perceave your newe charging of me with moo payementes veray shortely, which I cannot furnisshe as you make reconing of, by almoost xijd in the li, as my former hierwith doeth more plainly declaire unto you. Nevertheles, for that you must have all your appointementes performed according to your writing at every tyme, you must consequently be content to have monney for the same taken as th'exchaunge doeth serve from tyme to tyme, for otherwise cannot I performe your said appointementes./I spake to Mr. Coope by a chaunce befor the sight of your lettre from Teken, and at first he sayed his money must be redy for him the 6te of the next moneth, and soone after he sayed agen that nedes he must occupye the same monney, within thies iij or iiij days, and even so desireth me to make provision for monney for him accordinglye; and thus I se not howe to aunswer this payement to boeth your contentacions. Well, charge me dayly as you lyst, I must performe hier that I can, and as the tyme requireth, to moche to your disprofite (as I thinke) if your former writing be true./From Robert Androwe, even presently, I am writton unto that Edward Wourley haeth willed him by ij lettres to make him over 32li 13s 4d st., which my brother Richard Johnsone shuld apointe him to receyve of Jehan Mahewe. But my said brother haeth not advised him of anny suche thing, and therfor. Androwe requireth me to satisfye the foresayd Wourley, which I cannot do withoute further advertisement of the mater from my said brother Richard Johnsone, or you. And so must I aunswer Wourlay if he come to me, as well for this as for the monney of a pokett of fyne Marche receyved hier by me, in the 120li st. that I receyved of Bawdwin Paine long sins, being Maistres Fayre's and his, etc. Thus still ther cometh payementes of monney unto me from all sides for you, and I always empty-haunded, God send a good end of all./I have nowe also advise from the foresayd Androwe that Bartram Haghe haeth appointed him no monney thies Paesche maert payementes; but with the same adviso is a lettre come from Bartram Haghe (I say) from Daniell vand Heede of the 8th in this present, th'effect of the same (in that mater) being that if you write to him agen, as befor you writt to his father Bartram Haghe, he will lend you 200li Fl., and delyver the same to Robert Androwe if you so do write unto him to do (I say), for he repeteth that twys. The same lettre of Danielle's I kepe hier to aunswer as shortely as I can, and for lakke of tyme or helpe I send you not the copye, but with my next you shall have th'originall./Mr. Brudenelle's plate is fynisshed and shipped hietherward with stueff of Richard Whetelles: whan it is arryved, I will receyve it. The price therof doeth amounte to 42li 3s 3d Fl., which the said Androwe haeth paid of your monney in his haundes, etc./Ther is also shipped dyaper and sugar: write shortely for whom it is. And thus in moche hast fare you hartely well./Your loving brother,/Otwell Johnsone.//Th'exchaunge at Andwarpe, as Androwe writeth, is at 22s 1d for usans, and hier it is at 22s 4d at sight, ete.	sara	60af9ecbf038043336624b26	Johnson & Company	xx-xx-1518	Otwell	Male	Johnson		Protestant	Merchant; draper of London	sara		60af9ecbf038043336624b28	Johnson & Company	xx-xx-1514	John	Male	Johnson		Protestant	Merchant; draper and stapler	sara

OTWELL JOHNSON TO RICHARD JOHNSON//The 3de in Novembre, 1547, at London.//Thys shall let yow understand that according to my last wryting I have made further serche what good may be done by certain Flendres coynes of gold, to be convayed over hiether for the Kinge's myntes, etc., and I fynde that in philippus gildons (that ar valued at no more but 25 st. Fl. apiese, and so ar currant in all that countre) honnest proffitt is to be hadd, in suchewise as my brother John and I cannot devise anny better way to occupye ourselves with, than with transporting of the said coynes hiether, for I am at a pointe with one of the Mynte to have my redy monney within thre dayes, for howe moche soever I can brynge unto hym, a duodeze quasi percento .......... In other certain goldes also is not moch lesse proffit (as in small carolus gildons (I measne) of xld Fl. apiese and other) which I have not yet so perfaictly tryed as I have done the philippus, and therfore be doing with them first, and you shall have shortly knowledge of the rest of all thinges necessary./For the compasing of this enterprise, my brother John's mynd is that you should take paynes, incontinent uppon the sight of this my lettre, to prepar /e/ yourself with spede towardes Andwarpe, and ther, with the secret advise of Robert Androwe our frend, to go aboute this thing, taking up monney by th'exchang/e/ ther to be paid hier at usaunce or theraboute by me, and so to imploye the same monney presently upon the said philippus first, and afterward uppon carolus or other, as you shal be writton unto, and alwayes from tyme to tyme by trusty berars to convaye your goldes over hiether to my haundes. Wherfore I besieche yow do not slakke this mather, for doubt that anny other men may prevent us therin, and spare not to charge me with vCli st. or more in suchewise as is above-recited. Yea, though you gyve provision of a stuver Fl. in a piese of a philippus, rather then to be put by your porpos, so that thay may be of full weight, or at leest with thayer remedy, for ellis ther wil be losse by the weight hier. This mater must be haundled discretly, and with ernest request-making to Robert Androw to be secret? not declaring to him in annywise what proffitt you knowe expressly in them, but onely saying that you ar willed by me or my brother John to go aboute this thing in this wise, etc. Moreover, suche monney as he haeth in annywise good in his handes of my brother John's accompt, you may imploye first as afore is said, and send that away first surely, and so procede to the rest of your buysines above prescribed unto yow, with diligence, and often advertisementes by your lettres of your doinges from tyme to tyme. I intend to touche a litell of this mater in alettre to Robert Andrew myselfe tomorrowe, the next way, and so he shal be the redier for you against your coming./The premissis fynisshed, and going aboute to end this lettre with comitting you to the Lorde's preservacion, I receyved boeth youres by Aldersay and Bostocke, and have accepted your bill of 59li 3s 4d st., which shal be paid within thies ij dayes. Howbeit, I moche marvaill that yow, being charged but with the payement of 600 crownes sol. to Packington (whos bill was not yett come to your haundes as ye write) and having 500 of them redey by you, that (I say) you wold take 200 crownes of Mr. Whethell at such price as you write of, and so nowe to kepe 100 styll by you in vayne, or (at leest) to small proffit, and so charge me with the payment of that monney hier for your crownes, that my brother John hadd appointed to be sent him into the countre very shortly. When he shall therfor heare of this, he will marvaile as moche as I do, onlesse he knowe some other cause than he shewed me of./But well, nowe, in Gode's name putt fourth all the crownes that you have above above 600, for 6s apiese or better at Calleis (as yow wryte you can) for I intend not to charge you wyth payement of anny moo untyll I heare agen from you what nombre you have left, or how you can do with them, wherof I pay you wryte to me perfaictly from tyme to tyme, for ellis (perchaunce) for lakke of knowledge often of eche other's procedinges we may entre into a confusion of our thinges, and so therof may followe moche displeasur, and not withoute daungering of our credite peradventur. Before your going fourth, therfore, I pray you certifye me perfaictly of everything, and I shal not fayle to do the lyke unto you, and ordre everything accordingly by God's grace, Whom I beseche to send us a good successe of our entreprise, and preserve you in welfare.

When he interviewed the Imperial Ambassador early in December, he brought up the matter of her release. "He went on to say," wrote van der Delft, reporting his conversation to the Imperial Council of State, \'\'Now I have a case that I wish to recommend to you, concerning a woman belonging to Calais who after having taken more drink than sne should have done, at St. Omer, said certain words against the images of the saints, and is now a prisoner in consequence.\' With that, he showed me the letter from the officers of the law at St. Omer addressed to the Deputy of Calais, saying that they were awaiting the instructions of the Queen Dowager as to the decision of the case, the woman in question having contravened Her Majesty\'s ordinances. The Protector requested me to write to your lordships, begging that the woman might be released." The result of Somerset\'s inter- cession was only partly successful, so far as can be judged from vandder Delft\'s next letter to the Council of State. "I mentioned (to the Protector) in passing that I had written to your lordships about his request touching the Calais woman arrested at St. Omer, but that before my let- ters had reached you, the intercession of the English ambas- sador in Flanders and good neighbourship had caused the woman to be spared the full severity of the Emperor\'s ordi- nances, according to which she had deserved death. It seemed that the Protector was not over-pleased at this, for he had ready the minutes of the charges and evidence that your lordships had sent me: but I did not fail to point out to him that the correction was very favourable, and reques- ted him to use his best endeavours to prevent their subjects from committing in future and similar scandal; to which he replied "That is quite right".

My coseyn Otwell leid itt very ernestly to his charge, insomoche that he bare hym in hand that the wenche had confessid itt, put he utterly denied itt. If this be true, the partie that hathe accused her, whatsoever he be, is very moche to blame for the vyle thynge that was supposed her py her accuser to have nad.

Att the dethe of my wiffe I take God to judge nothing so moche did comforte me as the trust of her good bestowing. I trust before my commyng ye shall by your good discression ler/n/e somewhat of the trouthe to ease my poore harte, and if she be giltelesse, as my trust is in the Lorde that she is I shal be well eased, and I trust ye will then use her according; and if ye have herde from my cosen Otwell, I trust ye shall therby gather a grett lykelyhode whether she be gyltye or not.

It was agreed that the Commercial Convention shouid be renewed, Charles V being bound to ratify it within six months. The agreement was a diplomatic victory for Flanders, for as van der Delft himself wrote: "Wool is so dear here at present that this arrangement will be very greatly to the advantage of your Majesty\'s subjects. To such an extent is this recognised, that if I had not have gained over the Protector and Paget beforehand, I should never have been able to overcome the strong remonstrances that even now are daily being made by the English merchants against the serious loss to the country and to them, which will be caused by the agreement."

My former of the vj of this instant I mystrust not but ye have receyved. Your aunswer for Nicholles' and Baskerfelde's bylles, wherwith Robert Andrew writeth me he is charged, I do dayly loke for. By Andrewe's of the xjth of tunis present, I perceyve he hathe wrytten to youe of the same, and his conjecture is that my brother Otwell takyng up the same, dyd forgete to gyve youe advyse theroff. For so manny payementes as ye gave me knowleayge off, I have appointed the furnyture, and iff those bylles be ....... afforenamed, apon knowleage from youe or my broth/er/ Otwell receyved, I trust also to furnysshe them before the x/th/ in May, which is the date of your last byll./All our flete hathe arryved here in safftye in shippes, but so that th/e/ losse of goodes is more then hathe bene sene (as I gess/e/). For your parte ye have ij pokettes off lynsey and Cottes sore bur/ned/, and no canvas lefft. If my master (2a) and youe escape with the losse of iiijC felles clerely, it is besydes my hope, for in one ship called the James of Malden, Thomas Bromwod master, wherin ye had but iijC xx felles, I dare say there cannot be xlti felles made, for nothing is lefft of the peltes: only the wull remeyneth; and besydes that ye have jC burned felles./Nowe to advertyse youe of our procedynges here, ye shall perceyve that our Hollanders which were in Englond have by all meanes possyble gone abowte to have the Old Entercourse contynewed, and by perivate letters it is apparant unto us that it is ratytyed.

I trust ye wyl be contented with it, reconnyng it to be apon good occasyon; and in the hole bargain of ijC serpellers was promysed to be abated lxli, which dotae amownte to vjs on the serpeler./Sins that, I have sold to Jorys Hoghstreter my ij pokettes of Cottes, which he must pay for redy monny at xlvjli. Iff the rest had not bene gone to Vincent Duras I shold so have sold them, but that was the preparatyve for the rest to cum, for before none wold pas the old pryce./At our Courte this day, it is enacted that it shall be lawfull for anny man to ship new shorne clyffte wulles and none other at the next shippyng, and so fourthe tyll it be repelled./Greate communycacyon was also off benefyttes, and thet wulles myght yssue iiij and j, but it could take no place, allthoughe the heades, viz.

Iff the Hollanders contynewe obstynate (as they have done, and perswaded other men to do) affter this present day, every man is determyned that iff other men wyll buy theyr wulles, they shall have none./Newes here be none but that Miles Coverdale (2c) is here, and shall preache tomorowe. Off our other procedynges here as occasyon serveth I wyll write youe, God wyllyng, and wold be glad to heare that ye had receyved my former lettres.

OTWELL JOHNSON TO JOHN JOHNSON//At London, the 19th in April, 1548.//Your former lettres of the 10th and 13th of this present (brothe/r)/, I aunswered yesterday by the way of Tykeford, but this afternoone I receyved another from you of the 17th per Harrysone, therb/y/ perceaving howe largely you have and do intend to charge me with dayly payementes. Well, I will performe your appointement the best I can, but th'end of my last lettre unto you did declaire my refuge, wherin notwithstonding I will have the respect that you require, and is behoeffull for all consideracions, etc./Nowe Sir, touching lycence for corne, albeit that I hadd not hadd occasion to have aunswered nowe your lettre abovesaid by Harrysone, yet by this present my pretence was to have certified you that by good Armigill, (2a) our old and assured frend, I am informed this day in the morening that the restrainct of not carryeng fourth of anny grayne, is at lybertie, so that no lycence is to be required at this instan/t/. (3a) Nevertheles, within thies fewe late dayes mater was moved /in/ the Counsaile to cause a newe restraint to be proclamed, but after a better deliberacion taken, that comunicacion surcessed, and the setting fourth of the restrainct toke none effect; and so Mr. Wade's advise to us is to be doing in our achates (if anny we do intend uppon) with spede and diligence, for though a restrainte shuld sodainly ensue, yett he will provide no wourse measne for us than he did for the last you sent fourth. This his veray gentil/l/ proffer is wourthy of great thankes, and yett besides that he haeth promised me to make a frend to obtayne us an assured lycence (if he can) though the restrainct take grounde after that we be entered into our trade, so that we may nowe boldely in my consayte be doing to performe Garbrande's requestes; and therfor of an expres pourpos I have directly couvenanted with this berar, an honnest man, one William Scott of Sawtrey, being of Harrysone's acquaintaunce, to cause this present to be brought home unto you to Glapthorne by Satterday at night next; and therunto you may aunswer me, and the same to be at Tykeford by the morrowe after at night, and so to be hier with me on Twysdaye following. For uppon the same your advertisement, monney shal be provided for you with spede, and also Henry Garbrand writton unto to send you Flemyche hoyes to Lynne. Thus you perceave what is to be done hierin, etc./Your serpler of wull cometh very late nowe to be sold well, as I can suppose, for I cannot come to the price of your rest that I hadd befor, that you refused for it of Baesden. Cloethes have stukke somewhat in the sayles thies fewe late dayes, and yet the Hall is furnisshed of a great nombre, but I shall do what I can, etc./My blakke unwrought carsey that you hadd at Calleis to be sent into Flanders, I cannot heare of by Robert Androwe nor my brother Richard. I pray you in your lettre next to him, remembre the same./In my last I forgatt to write to you my Lady Crumwelle's aunswer for Fodringay, but ther is no losse to you to knowe it but nowe, bycause her sute cannot prevaile for you nor no man ellis, for my lord (1b) will kepe the thinges therunto belonging of anny proffite to himself, and the howse also, saving that my Lord Marquis of Northampton shall have th'use therof for the moost part at his owne pleasur, etc. (2b) And thus hierwith in hast, fare you well./Your loving brother,/Otwell Johnsone.//By Harrysone I will write you more as occasion shall serve, and send you some monney.

But those of youres, beyng copyes, do chaunce to cum to my handes before the orrygynalles, for the orrygynall of the xx in Aprill is not yet cum to my handes./The same ye write ye sent by Tykfford, but my cosyn Ambrose.

My ........

Yet nevertheles to enlarge theyr evyll pretenses with symple pollycye, I prey youe accept these fewe wordes. Theyr goyng over from hens was (as they reconned) very close. At theyr beyng at London they desyred frendshyp at the Cumpannye's handes, which was that (doyng as other men wold do) they myght have all the lowe sortes of wulles (which immedyately was graunted, and letters written hyther in theyr favour)./Then wrought they theyr feates, and dyd obtayne the ratyfying of th'Entercourse, (3a) which done they made a gloryous returne, and as ye understand by my former, made us sumwhat afrayed, and do that which sum of us do repent, for sum sold fyne Cottes for xlijli, and Marche for xxxvijli./Well, they then communed with us, and found us thus determyned, and so were aunswered that the goodes were owres and we couid not lyve to sell them affter the old price: wherfore lyke as when we bought good chepe, whe abated off the price set, so nowe buying deare, they shuld above that price gyve us as we /wol/d agre, for we declared unto them that rather then sell /as the/y would have us to do, we would kepe our wulles and /for/ced not. But they then went to all other straungers, and ............ them that they wold complayne iff they bought at ....... prices of the Entercourse. But that stayed us not, forasmoche as /we/ were advertysed that th'Emperour's Embassadour in England (1b) had declared to the Kynge's Majestye's Counsell that he thought it to be reasonable that we shuid enhaunce our prices in tyme of derthe, as we had abated in the contrary./Then for a refuge the botte knaves went to the Maiour's deputye, and requyred a protest under the towne seale to declare that we had refused to sell them wulles affter the old prices. The same was reffewsed them, wherfore theyr shote ancre beyng spent, they fell to requyryng of frendship as they dyd at London, end so apon submyssyon favour hathe bene shewe/d them/ by xs in a serpeller. And at the prices which I have sold they have bought iiij^xx serpellers, wheras iff they had not played the jackes, they myght, have had C serpellers more; and on my faythe if they had not bargayned with me when they dyd, I have saved for youe and me vjli which is gyven to lowtes./I prey youe (brother) mystrust not but all your commyssyons md my brother Otwelle's for payementes and other, shal be so observed and perfourmed as by the tyme shal be possyble./What may be done against the next shippyng I hope ye perceave by my letter of the xiiijth and xxijth, (2b) which is that only newe shorne clyffte wulles may be then shypped. I wold ye had felles inowe, for they wyll away as we /thynke/. For lacke of wulles end felles, I thynke the Hollanders /wyl1 cum/ over agayne and buy middell Marche.

I do at all tymes and in al thimes for you that I can, and with right good will, and therfor I pray you content yourself accordingly, providyng from hensfourth if you can (as indede (perchaunce) you may) to acquainte yourself with such chepemen or other that bring up thayer monneys often hiether, to leffe it with you, and than spare not wekely to charge me with as moche as you lyste, to pay it them hier agen. And that shall bring moche ease to me and quietnes of mynd to yourself: otherwise you must take the performance of your said appointementes as I am able to compasse them, in good wourth./And thus remitting all other maters bakke untill my next writing, in moche hast I end for this instant, and yett I doubt moche the berar abovenamed wil be departed befor the closing hierof; and so with harty comendacions to my syster, and thankes for her token, fare ye boeth well./Your loving brother,/Otwell Johnson.//Add.

OTWELL JOHNSON TO JOHN JOHNSON//At London, on May day 1548.//According as I doubted (brother) in th'end of th'inclosed, /as in/dede it chaunced, of George Graunte's departing befor the finisshi/ng/ theror, (1a) howbeit I trust the lxli st. sent by him is s/av/ely delyvered unto your haundes./And for further aunswer /to/ your lettre receyved by Sandford than the said inclosed doeth containe, the chieff mater that I consider to be touched, is to advise you to imploye diligens aboute the providing of malte for the purpos you knowe of, but not to suche nombre as boeth Garbrante's lettre do make mencion of, for that wer great folly. (2a) Howbeit, to beginne with 1,000 quarters at leest, or xvC, wer no fault at all, Yea, if you could ernest more also than that nombre you shall not do amysse I thinke./For if moche shal be sent over by us, a good deale wold be ernested at the beginning, boeth for doubt of the price rysing, and also of a restrainct coming upponhaund, which indede I somewhat feare, bycause the bruite of warre with Fraunce agen increaseth moche dayly, or (at leest) manny shrode lykelyhoodes therof appier. Neverthelesse, I have befo/re/ this advertised you of our refuge by Mr. Wade for so moche as shal be bought by you aforehaund, by his owne assured promis, which we may be bold to trust unto, as you knowe, etc./For shipping to be. sent unto you owte of Flandres to Lynne, I have alr/edy/ writton twys to Garbrand, and yett in my n/ext/ lettres I w/ill/ memorate the same thing unto him, and th/e reply I trust/ wil not be long from thens. I have willed /the/ sa/i/d Garbrand /to/ direct hiss hippes by his lettre to Mr. Pace the Custumer, or to my cosin Edmond Solme; you may therfor gyve your man suche advertisement. Mr. Pace is nowe hier, for what mater I cannot tell. I intend to shewe him of my foresaid appointement, and by him at his departing to write the lyke to the foresaid Solme, if I do it not sooner./Your serpler of wull shall be sett a-wurke on, to be wounde, for cloethyars be at a staye to buy anny more untill sheretyme, as they shewe me that I am acquainted with, and than thay looke for moche better chepe ware than this of youres is; and the like hope I perceave almoost in all men. Our c/o/sin Johnsone of St. Albons this day dyned with me, and to him I touched superfycially that which you write of to my brother Richard, saying that I supposed tha/t/ he wold shortely write unto him for the providing ij or iij lodes of wull in his countre; and his aunswer was that he shuld nott misse of his helpe, but for the prices he thought thay wold downeward apace, for even nowe alredy (sayed he) all men covett to sell and no man to buy. He is nowe ridden into Norfokk/e/, but will be at St. Albons agen within xij or xiiij dayes, etc./For providing of monney in the countre by you (if you can), and to charge me with the payement therof agen hier, I have ernestly ynough writton unto you by th'inclosed, and therfor pretermitte the same hier. And I will also intreat with Mr. Pace if I can to carry some with him at his going/e/ hens: more I cannot do./I have not charged my brother Richard, nor Robert Androwe, with anny m/ore/ payementes than my late advertisement to you did mencion of, taken of Baskerfeld for the last in June next, for all the sending of the last 60li st. unto you, nor for having Mr. Teringham's monmy in a redines hier; but for the next that shal be sent or otherwise occupied hier, must passe by th'old refuge. Th'exchang doeth somewhat ryse, for on Monday last the sight was at xxjsxjd, usans at 22s 1d, double usans 22s 4d and no lesse, etc., but derar pro rata./To Francis Samuel I have paid presently, for your bill due to Parson Saxby, vjli xvijs vjd st.

OTWELL JOHNSON TO JOHN JOHNSON//At London, the 5th in May, 1548.//By Wedd this berar (brother) I receyved your lettre this day aboute noone, and therby perceave th'ordre of your procedinges aboute the provision of grayne to s/en/d to Garbrand, which I do not dislyke, but yett I thinke /a mo/re expedicion wold be to send some away from Lyn/ne/ to /Flaund/eres, while_some other is a-providing in Cambridgeshie/r; For I reme/mbre the lettes you shewed me of the last tyme you sent g/rayne/ owte of that countre to the Hollanders, caused a long staye of the furtherans that some other men hadd, that toke thayer grayne nyher thayer porte. But well, I referre all to your good dys/crecio/n. For my parte I will gladly make you redy from tyme to tyme as moche monney as I can compasse to come by at anny reasonable reconing, howbeit nowe th'exchaunge is ryssen sore sins the last weke, for the sight is at 22s 1d, usans 22s 4d, double usans 22s 8d, and so upwarde more pro rata, as for thre monethes is above 23s, and no lykelyode of anny fall this hole moneth, as men conjecture. Well, thinges must be taken in good parte as thay can be hadd. The taking of monney for the yeir, Raymond can do me no good in as nowe, nor one broker or ij moo that I have sett a-worke theraboute, and therfor ar old refuge must serve our tairne whan we shall nede./As yett I have taken no more monney for your accompt but that I have writon of unto you befor, but yesterday I bargained with Thomas Lokke for 100li st. at usans after 22s 2d by broker, but I cannot spede so well agen. I intend to charge Henry Garbrand with the payement therof, bycause I wold dryve of the tyme as long as I can in taking of anny for us. Of this said monney, Egylsfeld haeth 50li st. for your part this day, and as moche more for Mr. Cave, as I have writton unto him by this berar; and yesterday by Adam Aldaye: I sent xlli to my syster your wiff; and xli more I do appointe Sir Thomas Brudenell to pay you at home, for that I have disbursed so moche hier for his lyverey cloeth: and so you se howe that hole 100li is bestowed. More shal be sent as anny trusty convaye can be espyed owte, God willing. To Mr. Breten I have alredy paid xli, and tomorrowe or the next day he looketh for xxli more. And my brother Richard haeth charged me presently with the payement of other xxli to Mr. Smyth for Mr. Cave's accompt, but I write nothing to him therof, nor you nede to say nothing, untill the said Mr. Smythe's coming home, etc./William Palley is in my debt. aboute xviij or xixli st. I understond he haeth x or xijli therof redy to send up hiether unto me, therfor I pray you comon with him, and if you perceave he is so mynded, desire him to pay it unto you, geving him a remembraunce of your haund for so moche as you receyve of him. But I pray you require no more but as of his owne good will he shall be mynded to send up nowe unto me./Of prices of wulles and cloethes I can write you but smally as yet. Sut cloethes of all sortes kepe thall (1b) still more than they did anny tyme this vj monnetnes befor, but I here of small abatementes in thayer prices as yett; howbeit the staye of buying shall of force bring downe the prices, etc./From the Sussex men I have receyved aboute xvij dossen di. of sommer felles, and xxvj dossen of winters, and moo I looke not for from them, but th'overplus of myn ernest shal be repaid me in redy monney within thies iij or iiij dayes. I shewed you at your last being hier what recompense thay offred me by writing (that was the abatement of xijd in every dossen), and more I cannot gett with thayer goodwilles, and in good fayeth I thinke it not reasonable to contend moche with them for more. And thus hierwith I pray you satisfye yourself and Mr. Cave, for I can do no better for you. So knowith the Lord, Who kepe you in welfaire.

And first knowe that the foresaid Preston hadde away with him one C iiij^xx 11, (I say) 180li st., wherof he did chaunge 100li into gold for the easyar carryage, and paid for th'exchaunge therof himself, as he shall gyve it you in reconing; of the which 180li, I toke nothing more by th'exchaunge than as my former lettres did mencion, that is the last was taken of Thomas Blanke the yonger, vic't 100li st. for the last in Septembre at 22s 10d, wherof I paid to your fellmonger Pourvay, and to Mr. Anthony Cave I have and must pay, 40li st., and rather more than lesse. But yett I made shifte to furnisshe Preston of so moche mony as afore is sayed, bycause you shuld seldom send for anny hiether if it might be expressely; howbeit, for the next that you shall nede of, I knowe no trusty convaye: provide yourself for it as your haste shal be. And after tomorrowe I will not be unfurnisshed of monney for your next sending, God to frend, for I conside/r/ that I may be bold than to take mony for double usaunce, which will fall not long befor th'end of Septembre (by which tyme I trust your fleat wil be discharged at Calleis) and so I hope spede you for 22s 8d or (perchaunce) under./Of the monney that Preston hadd last away, I have appointed none to be imployed in wheat except he did se good cause, vic't. uppon that he shewed me, and you writt the lyke, that one hadd provided him a shippe at Lynne for the purpos. I consailed him that incontinent after his ryding to Glapthorne, and leving ther vj^xxli at leest for your affaires, he shuld spedely ryde to Lynne with the rest, and lade away that shippe that was stayed for him, in case he could find a measne to dispatche her within th'end of this weke, and with the wheat, to send away th'oetes that lay at Lynne, yf he could not sell them away ther owte of haund, and so with all diligence possible to rydd himself and all our buysines from Lynne aforesaid for this seasone, making lyke spede to advertise me of all his procedinges ther befor my going oversee, to th'end that I may the more perfaictly conclude all our thinges with Garbrand & Compaigny at our being ther together./If you lyke this myn advise to him, you may by your lettre prikke him foreward to procede, or ellis write him your better ordre in all thinges as you perceve cause. And further I shall desire you (for so am I writton unto by Garbrand aforenamed in the name of his compaignye to do) to take paynes to send me veray shortely, th'abstract of your achatt and lading away of all the grayne, with the chargis accordingly, for thay ar veray desirous to se the same, bycause thayer custome is to close up thayer bookes of accompt aboute the last in July every yeir, etc./Touching your neighbours' delyverance owte of Northampton Jayle, I have as yett done nothing, bycause of Mr. Armigille's (1b) being at the Courte, which is at Hampton Court, and also at his coming from thens his repayre is to Yslington, for ther is his howsehold nowe, so that I could in nowise hietherto speke with him. But for the best remedy, I have this day copied owte that note of your lettre that concerneth that mater, and withall have ernestly writton unto him therin, which I have sent to his lodging in Yslington aforesaid, for to be delyvered to him at his next repayer thiether, so that after his sight therof, I doubt not. but he will take paynes to performe all your request so farre fourth as he can, but yett I feare moche it shal not be alltogethers in souche ordre as you write of.

The consideracion wherof also on myn owne behalf provoked me to make my full provision for that shippe hier, which indede I attend uppon, to have it all hier this weke, and therfor went not from hens to Ely to send you anny keles downe to Yaxley for to fett up that corne afterhaund, etc., but it must remayne ther untill we take in haundes to lade another shippe, which in nowise can be done withoute a specyall lycens, for yesterday cam hiether a new restraint from the Counsaile (which shal be hier proclamed tomorrowe) disanulling all old lycences, and so no grayne shall passe fourth withoute a newe lycens to be obtained after the proclamacion made. (1a) Wherupon I pretend to enter my corne that I will nowe lade, uppon Calleis, trusting within the tyme lymited for a certyficate to be brought (which is iiij monnethes) to gett the lettre that I have writton for of my Lord Protectoure's grace or the Counsail, by Mr. Wade's helpe, or ellis otherwise to please wr. Pace; for I stond in doubt of the lewdenes of moche of the people hier, and therfor name that that I lade uppon Calleis. And yet neverthelesse, I am in buysines, and doubt not to retain the shippe that I have freighted, by reasone of one Thomas Grimbold, not farre of a neighbour of youres, that in myn absens iij dayes past haeth marked the shippe to serve the King with carriage of stone to London, as Preston can shewe you thole combersome storye therof by mought./Of your other long mater concerning our charging of Robert Androwe, knowe that the note that I send you in my lettre from Cambridge was true, whatsoever you conjecture to the contrary, and I thinke it may appier to be 80, or within a lytell, by your receytes of monney from me sins Midsomer, and payementes for you at London to your fellmongers, etc. For besides the somes that you recite in your lettre nowe sent me, I finde due: Due the last in September, payeable to Mychell and Jerome Dyodati, taken of Germyn Cyoll 23th in June last. 115li 8 4 Fl./Of Phelippe Cockram and John Barthilmew the 3de in July, payeable the first in October, 20li st. more than your lettre doeth mencion, at 23s 1d Fl. 023li  1 8/And last of all, for the 100li st. taken of Moresyn de Maryny, payeable the last of this monneth, which left at London for fellmongers, and to be sent you 111li 5 0/Soma Totalles, besides all thinges cont. in your lettre, and the monney brought hiether with me for corne at this viage. 249li 15 0 Fl./But yet one of the Cli brought hiether for corne is taken for the last in October, and th'other for double usance from the 28th of the last, and of them same ij somes you may estime what you will to be paid unto Robert Androwe agen per Jehan de Lobell & Compaigny. But as for the sale of our old corne doeth moost haunge in debt, as you shall perceave by thayer reconing at iny coming unto you, and not befor, and therfor use your owne discrecion in sending for monney to London; for geving you this declaracion I can appointe no tyme that monney may be taken for, nor what some, for you may se best your owne nede; and as fore anny knowledge of your sales at Calleis, I have not hadd hiether from my brother Richard no more than you. And therfor all thinges well considered together, I thought it best to advise you, as befor I have done, not to charge our frend Robert Androwe with anny payement for anny money to be nowe taken, sooner than double usaunce at adventure (th'interest of 200li being but ijd, or at moost iijd in a li more), and by that tyme (God willing) you shall be sure to be able ynough at that side the sees to defend all together, and kepe our credite in every behalf.

OTWELL JONSON TO JOHN JOHNSON//At London, the l2th in December, 1548.//The last weke (brother) per my cosin Ambros Sanders by the waye of Tykeford, I aunswered youres of the first of this present from Glapthorne, wuich I required him to send unto you afterhaund. But not having anny wourd therof from you this weke, I have taken further occasion to write you this present, therby certefiens you that sins my sayd aunswer, I have lerned that my cosin Lawrens Sanders is at no certaintie of his coming unto you, and therfor I lakke the trusty convaye of the monney thet in your former you writt for, untill my brother Richard Johnsone's coming downe unto you, or to Tykeford, which you may perceave by his inclosed. But yett wher he writeth of his intent to tarry hier in London but one day, I suppose iiij wil be fewe ynough for him, though it wer but for want of hoerses; howebeit, it may be that he knoweth howe to spede himself redely, for I perceave not that he writeth to you for anny, nor to Tykeford also: onely in his lettre to me with the other abovesaid to you, he requireth me to send wourd to St. Albons for a hoerse for nimself, if anny be ther bought for him by our lytle cosin, which I thinke is not. But well, etc., for that mater./Nowe touching Robert Androwe's complaint for lakke of furniture sufficient to aunswer all that he is charged with uppon your accompte, I have no further to say in it than I writt you of in my last; and even sins I have moost ernestly requested (by my lettres) John de Lobell & Compaignye to furnysshe him of the 3001i Fl. that I writt for long sins more than ones, wherfor if it be not paid him, I am not culpable. A great faulte of the performance of my request, I suppose, is by reason of Garbrande's absens, who departed from Lylle towardes Bourdeaulx the 17th of the last, as I was advertised by lettre receyved yesternight from John de Lobell himself, bering date the 28th of tha same; and in the same also he did certefye me of th'arryvall in savetie (thankes be to God) of our hewe with the last malt, and of the sale of part therof for shorte dayes to sure men, trusting to dispatche the rest veray shortely, and therfor requireth more to be sent him. But I have none other confort for obtayning of lycence than in my last is mencioned, so that I can devise no better way than I gave you adviso of lately, to send him that is alredy bought, etc./The prices of the malt sold he doeth not write of, but is ernest in requiring more to be sent him shortely, and haeth consigned unto me from Roan in a shippe of Flysshing, 40 ponchions Auserois newe win, 12 ton vin blanc de Court, end 11 pipes of primes, allredy laden. The wayting for the same and (perchaunce) other thinges from some other of my frendes, shal be th'onely lett of my coming to you this Christmas, but if I come not (as I will if I can by anny measnes) I will send all notes necessarye to clear your reconinges with Mr. Cave and my brother Richard Johnsone. And thus in moche hast, wisshyng to here of my syster's good delyverans, I bidd you well to fare./Your loving brother,/Otwell Johnsone.//Comfettes for my syster your wiff I receyved sins my last writing unto you from my brother Richard, which I send with other to Tykeford by this berar: I trust thay shall come savely unto you. A pott with succate I have also, but this berar could not carry it at this instant. Going aboute to close up this lettre, an honnest man of Walgrave brougnt me youres of the 9th of this present, which I have no tyme nowe to aunswer in never a point of it.

But yett Robert writeth nothing of the receyt therof, howebeit indede I have hadd no lettre from him later than that wherof I sent you the copye by Raeff the last day, nor himself is not yett come over that I can lerne; and thus hierof I can write you no more at this tyme./From Hugues de Lobell I am certefied further of the sale of moost of our last malte at Ypre, after 25 end 23.5 patters, the mesure of that towne, payeable at Ypre maert next, falling the second weke of Lent. what the measure is I cannot shewe you, but he writeth that the gaignes is reasonable, for it is 3 or 4 stuvers more in a measur than our first grayne was sold for ther, and yet it was faultye with long laying a shippe-bourd end perisshed with wyvelles; and therfor thay will in nowise have anny more old malt sent to them. And for that cause it shal be good to make youres (that is at Yaxley) away at Lynne, wher I understond it is wourth above vs a quarter nowe, and so it will be more proffite for us to do, than to shyppe it over, and to pay iijli st. for lycens of every C coumme, as I am informed that men sell so./I cannot perceve that the beforenamed de Lobelles make any reconing to pay Robert Androwe anny more monney but the 200li Fl. aforemencioned, for in his lettre nowe sent me he declaireth thayer receytes not to be 600li in all, and therof is to be deducted the 100li, st. that you retayned from sending over at your last being in London, etc., the copye of which lettre I will send you in my next./White hering is wourth 12.5li Fl. in Zeland, as this man writeth, and et Dunkerke it is at 41 crownes soll. a last, as Robert Brunell writeth, so that therfor it is not best medlyng with anny at thies prices in my fantasy, and indede I write not nowe for anny.

And therfor truely I am dryven to an urgent perplexite, namely therunto adjoynning the general restraint or rather arrest at Aundwarpe of all our Englisshe marchantes bodys and goodes, which is also chaunced this last weke, beginning uppon occasion of a stay made by certain our Englisshe shippes in the Narrowe of xl or L hewes and other shippes bound with hering into France, which indede wer shortely released agen, but thoes newes go not so soone to the Fleminges' eares as other did, and so our men and goodes aforesaid remayne still under arrest, with threatninges (as we heare) that thay wil be recompensed of all the robberys that thay have suffred at rovers' haundes this 2 yeires past, which thay putt fourth to be lytell lesse than 100,0001i (I say) one C M. li Fl., as the talke goeth. (1a)/This trouble doeth vehemently put men in feare of a moche greater inconvenience to come, and doeth alltogether stay my provision for your great paymentes at haund, for that almoost no man will gyve anny monney owte for Fla/und/res untill a release be hadd of that is stayed; and thus in thies doubtfull termes I stand for your affaires, which forceth me more justely to be disquieted for the performans of all thinges, than you hadd occasion to be greved with my writing unto you somewhat prescissely ij wekes past of so largely overcharging of me, as you did.

Moreover, I looke to heare shortely from Andwarpe of the payement of another bill of myne to Thomas Nicolles which was due the 10th of this monneth, and so we shall lakke no payementes eche in other's necke, God send me monney to discharge all./The wul-winders have done with me, and ar gone from me, but I have promis of thayer helpe agen at your nede befor your shipping.

OTWELL JOHNSON TO JOHN JOHNSON//At London, the 18th in February, 1551.//By the lettre hierwith (brother) which shuld have ben sent per William Brickett, you may perceave what I hadd than to write of. But sins having receyved your long lettres per Richard Harryson, and perceaving you to be at Tykeford (wher you intend to remayne this hole weke) or at leest at Checheley, I tooke the foresaid lettres from Brycket aforsaid to send unto you hierwith, etc./And further I do you to wytt, that of the foresaid Bricket, Harryson haeth receyved lxli (I say) 60li Englisshe, for the which I have made him a bill of my haund, to be repaid 40li therof by you at his retourne nowe home, and th'other xxli he will forbeare untill aboute Midlent, and so have I writton to my syster your wiff to use him. What some of monney the foresaid Harrysone will require more of me hier befor his departing hens, I do not yett certainly knowe, nor himself cannot also tell, but if it passe not xxli or xxxli, I shal be able I /trust by/ th'end of this weke to lett him have it, the better for that /Nico/las Bury's billes doeth serve our tourne so well as to aunswer our mamsey debt, which I thinke will be all paid this weke or in the beginnyng of the next, by Gode's grace. And as touching all our other debtes hietherto growen (I measne for monney by exchange) I have holy paid 8 dayes past, and 80li more for my brother Richard's bill to George Parson, having also 40li besides in a redines to clear another bill of his in William Judde's haundes, wherof I have at large advertised him the last weke per Robert Androwe our frend, at whos retourne to Andwarpe (which I suppose might be yesterday) our sayd brother may retourne home, having sett suche a due order in our thinges ther, as I perceave he was mynded to do. And so, being come to Calleis, agen, he haeth promised me by his last lettres of the 7th of this present (withoute any to you) to make as moche monney over from thens as can be made of our wheat or otherwise, wherunto I have even as ernestly required him by my lettre yesterday sent him per John Hampton, and sent him your last adviso to put our monney at Andwarpe to th'exchaunge, if anny ther be unappointed, which I cannot certefye you of; howbeit, I thinke not moche, for besides 96li 17s 8d Fl. which he paid Mychell Mulier almost 3 wekes past, for our due of yron and sope in January, he writeth in his last aforesaid to me to have paid the said Mulier 200li Fl. at the writing of the same, uppon a reconing of all that is /due/ to him this hole moneth of February; and further I have willed him to /paye/ other ijCli (at leest) or 50li more (if he can spare it) to Pascal de Vilemonte or Compaigny, for so moche and more of thayers hier occupied aboute our payementes abovemencioned, etc./Moreover, ther was due aboute this middes of this monneth 200li Englisshe to Davy Appowell and Thomas Nicolles, for so moche taken of them soone after your last departing hens, as you knowe; and what shifte may be made to differ Mr. Woodroeffe's monney and Mr. Cave's, the last of this monneth, I have referred it to his discrecion uppon the sight of your lettre aforesaid. From /h/ens can no more monney be made over untill God send hiether our Gascon wins to make money of, which I hope must nedes be within a day or ij as the wind is, or ellis it is not well with them, howbeit other men want thayers also, as well as we do oures./For Gascon wins to be sent to Lynne owte of Zeland, if it be not done from hens spedely, it cannot be sooner than better store may arryve thiether, for the northerley windes that have so long blowen have kept theyr fleat of shippes from them, as well as we have wanted oures thus long. And therfor satisfye yourself and be assured, that whan anhy better store is either hier or ther, our customers' and frendes' tournes at Lynne and in the countre shal be as spedely served as may be (God willing), and some seckes shal be also sent with th'other wins.

And further, for the aunswer ot youres receyved by Mr. Jennyns, I prey youe understand that I do perceave howe ye take myne abstract; and concernyng Robert Andrew's parcell, which ye wryte shuld be 100li lesse, indede I knowe it shuld be so, but my brother Otwell by his letter sent me by the sayed Andrew wylled me to let it stand as it dyd, and at your cummyng to London ye wold gy/ve/ order for it, and therfore I reconned it not./Also, where ye /wryte that/ I have appointed long sins 52li 11s 6.5d to your accomp/t o/f /those/ wulles which my cosyn Ambrose had of me, I am well assured th/at/ the lyke somme I have not wrytten youe off, for he had only ij pokettes Barkes old aftter 371i le serpeller, wheroff the one is returned. But I fynd that I made youe answer to a letter of youres_(wherin ye wrote that ye made reconnyng that Ambrose Saunders shuld allowe 37li st. table) that the sa/me/ shuld be applyed to your accompt; but I trust ye wyll not thy/nke/ I take that from youe which ye ought not to have, for there were but vj pokettes Barkes of my marke, wheroff ij have issued with wull of, Ambrose Saunders, ij with wull sold by youe to John Hadebault, and other ij by me of late to Joys Shorer. He must aunswer youe xijli vjs viijd st. table for one pocket Barkes, and that is all which ought to be deducted of 52li 11s 6.5d Fl., which I have made youe debitour for./Further, where ye write that I do not allowe youe the 100li which in my former abstractes I wrote I had furnysshed, eyther in the writyng of the same I was to moche abused, or elite I have done it. For by my copye kept ot the same, a I do fynd that whereas ye shuld be debytour unto Ambrose Saunders for iiij pokettes Barkes sold to Sho/rer/, and iij pokettes middell Barkes sold to Arrent Gheretzon of Leythe, the somme of 103li 2s 8d Fl., I have charged youe but with 003li 2s 8d, saying within the lyne "besydes 1001i, furnyssned by me", so that if it be in the same (as I mystrust not but it is), I trust I have not therby dysapoynted youe./I kn/o/we well my /brother Otwell/ hathe dysbursed those sommes which ye wryte me off /nowe unto/ William Judde and my cosyn Asster, and iff all thynges had framed /as/ I thought they would, he shuld have had a good porcyon off it again by this tyme.

I have also wrytten unto hym for the payment of Pierre Artus of 150li accordyng to your wrytyng, and assuredly brother, it was a parte or my remembrans lefft hym for the furnyture of jCli to hym./Further I have writton hym off the allowans which he must make owte of Mr. Cave's accompt of the 45li 8s 4d, with the lyke apprest; the same dyd I also wryte unto hym by my letter of the ixth in Marche. Iff my tarying in Andwerpe myght have done good, I wold I had not cum from thens yet, but havyng nothyng to make monny of there wherby I myght have furnysshed our want, I knowe that Robert Andrew by all other meanes can supplye our busynes there better then I, and so at my departyng from thens he promysed he wouid.

The wynes which be yet to sell arre holden (in the marchante's abscens) at xv crownes sol. the ton, and to take good and bad; there is xxv tonne in all. Apon Ester Monday the marchant wyl be here, and then I wyll not fayle to be doyng with hym, for my Lord Deputye (1b) hathe agayn promysed me lycens for suche as I shall buy./I do dayly loke for a ship of Frenche wynes which Ropert Brunel hathe lefft order with me to receyve. Iff ye thynke it good that I shall bargayn with hym for parte or all, advertysyng me of the pryce at London and of your mynd, I wyll worke accordyngly./Hierin I send you a byll off Robert Brunelle's to Jacques de la /Faille/ for the p/aymen/t of certain monny (which shal be abowte xxli) to my brother Otwell or youe. His promys to me is th/at/ it is redy, and therfore I trust ye shall have it at the first askyng./Bycause I purpose to buy the wynes beffore-written if it be possyble, and that monny is very skant here, I thynke to take here xx or xxxli of Jonn Mayette's man, to be paid within iij dayes atiter sight at London.

(1a) And first, /concer/ning the sending over of anny store of gold, truely I cannot do it, for it is wonderfull skant to come by nowe, and not under .... but yet not so anny quantite, and th'exchaunge nowe falling it wil not be so hadd. The rate of angelles, crownes sone, and other goldes I sent you a note of in my last per Robert Dyall of Guysnes, and therfor I do not charge myself with taking up of anny more monney by th'exchaunge, sins the 200li Englisshe hadd of Richard Wentford the 25th of this moneth for double usans after 13s 9d, payeable to Jeronimo Rovelascha, amont. to 127li 10s Fl., which I made applyable to my cosin Ambros Sanders accompt, etc.; bycause that therwith I paid Maistres Dayrell your aunte myself, furnisshing the rest of her due, which was 288li ls 8d Englisshe, whos aunswer to my cosin Ambros lettre my cosin Blase (2a) sent him over per my brother Warner, as I myself did write to you at large by him of everything than occurrant, etc. Monney to be taken for a yeire's day of payement, withoute interest, perchaunce I can spede of to the value of 2 or 300li, but than I knave not howe to gett gold for it, nor yett make it over to our profite. And therfor having your further advis, I will therin procede as you shall it best thinke it for our profite: profite, I measne, that it might soone ynough be convayed over either by th'exchaunge or otherwise, to serve our tourne for our payementes at Andwarpe this day due and dayly approching, the note wherof I trust is savely come to your haundes. Mr. Cave's money that boeth he and you willed me to take up for him to send to Calleis very shortely, I did not fayle to provide incontinently after the receyt of his lettre, which I hadd for double usaunce of Bastiano de Franco, after 13s 11d, payeable to thayers of Bonaventure Micheli, Jeronimo Arnolfini & Compaigny in Andwarpe, the same being delyvered yesternight unto Hill, Mr. Tresorar's servaunt of Calleis, for to be convayed with other charge of the Kinge's Majestie, trustyng the same will be shortely /at/ Calleis. With the same ther is for us, in a small trusse put into the middes of the bagge, 40.5-sufferans and 72 crownes sol.; and tomorowe I hope to gett 100.5-sufferans more, which I pretend to adventur by Henry Gherens (notwithstonding the late losse that Browne ..... to fall on some of your Compaigny) for I knowe Gherens sure. Your quayles I have receyved according to writing in nombre, and Maistres Graunte haeth also Mr. Cave's part./But as for anny porcion of thempsede, Maistres Burnell would not part with unto neither of us, I thanke me for her, and therfor after haeth ben bought.

I pray you, procure to send me spedy wourd howe the case stondeth, and also I expect your lyke aunswer unto the said Wilmote's lettre that I sent you, concerning your payement to him the last of this moneth present day, (1b) for I wil not charge myself with taking of any more monney by th'exchaunge withoute a very urgent cause, etc./My cosin Blase hasth also shewed me of 100li that his brother Ambros haeth writton to him that he shuld demand of me for him, by your appointement, but therof you have writton nothing. I pray you do shortely. And thus in hast making an end, I besieche the Lord kepe you in welfaire./Your loving brother,/Otwell Johnzon.//Add.

(sans compter l'advantaige d'ung pattart par piese des primiers); and this I pray you accept in wourth if thay come to you. This doubte I put for that I was not sure whether this said berar shall bring you the foresaid packet or not, bycause that at the writing hierof I hadd not spoken with him, but at adventure I made it redy for him, etc. Also whether he haeth that or no, th'other that long sins I writt you of to be in a bagge of shillinges for Mr. Cave, I trust shall nowe come savely unto you by him, and more shall hierafter by other, if I can gett any, for dayly it skanteth and increaseth in price above measur: xjs lucre in a li is nowe the leest, but myn abovesaid (I measne the last) cost but 10s per li, and I thinke it not good to passe that price in providing of any, considering great doubte of thayer fall in price at Andwarpe, as our frend Robert Androwe haeth nowe twyse or thyrys so writton unto me lately; and even in lyke manner he affirmeth of his receyt of the crownes rose that I shewed you of to differ from my sending, notwithstonding my brother Richard his saying unto you that he supplied the want of the said crownes with angelles, and therfor trye you the trueth better if you can./From Mychel Mulier I have lettres of the receyt of myn that I sent you open for Garbrand and him, but no resolute aunswer thay make of thayer mynd for thayer Spanyche viage./But monney still Mychel writeth for, and indede I suppose that I have receyved 100li, of thayeres sins Garbrand his departing hens, which I would gladly thay hadd./To Pasquall & Compaigny I thinke we owe yett (at leest) 20011, which also wer not reasone that thay shuld want long, for thaundling of thayer thinges haeth done us moche plesur./Your lettres to Gifford and Mr. Lignt (1b) I shuld nave sayed first - I have receyved and delyvered. Thay have boeth promised to aunswer you shortely, but of Mr. Ligh looke for no grace so farr as I can discerne, whatsoever will come from Mr. Waren./Cooke the butcher his man haeth seen your shepe, but he wil not passe the price of viijs apiese and pay you according to your covenaunt, and hierunto he requireth your spedy aunswer./The devision of my oncle Johnson his plate and other thinges I thinke wer very necessary to be made shortly, for succouring of my aunte Johnson, who I understond is ungentilly delt with.

Cloeth is above all measure hightened in price sins your being hier, and so is lede, tynne and all other marchandis, besides that moost men that have suche good ware, thay wil not part from it as yett, so that I am utterly at my wittes' end howe to make anny provision for wares or monney agenst the vyntaige, either for Spaigne or Bourdeaulx, and I am sure I am not alone in that case. Money I suppose I could find the measne to gett plenty ynough for our occupying, but than not knowing howe to imploye it withowte great daunger of losse anny kind of way (namely for that I perceave heed and chieff men afrayed of a soudain calling downe for the reasons recited in my former writing).

But would to Our Lord that I hadd been with her befor her departing! And also I would that some more gentilnes hadd ben shewed her on my oncle her howsebounde's executoures' behalf, and other suche as made themselves buysy with his goodes than I feare ther was, and than hadd it ben better (perchaunce) with her, with us, and with themselves peradventure at lenght. But at thayer perilles be it, and God be Judge of all./This soudain warening of the Lorde's on one side (brother), and the gredines of moost men noweadayes to embrase that doeth chaunce, on th'other, lett move you, I pray you, to call for a devision and accompt of that shuld appertaine unto us of my oncle's goodes aforesaid, befor your nowe coming from Calleis, for you knowe our right is more justely therin than thayers that will be moost grediest to it. Well, use your discretion in all thinges, wherunto I referre me./My aunte's debt unto me was above 25li Englisshe, and my oncle's for the last payement of the last cloeth that I sent him (which I paid for at Alhollowemes last) was above 12li, the just note wherof you shall have in my next lettre; howbeit, th'executoures aforesaid knowe that, and my oncle Pouncherdon th'other by my lettres to my aunte.

RICHARD JOHNSON TO JOHN JOHNSON//Jhesus, at Andwerpe, the xxj in September, 1551.//Affter my moest harty commendacyons (beloved brother) my last was sent from hens yesterday by post, trustyng the same is cum to your handes. Sins, even this day, I have receyved your ij letters of the x and xij of this moneth from Glapthorne, and concernyng the fyne the myddell Marche which ye fynd in Robert Andrewys abstract, the truthe is that for the furnyture of our payementes I dyd practyse to sell so moche to Otto Mahiew, with whome when I could not agre, and had declared to Robert Andrew what he offred, his advyse was that I shuld not sell so vyly to a straunger, saying "Let me have them di. li in a serpeller better chepe, and eyther I have deserved it, or wyll do". I partly graunted hym, and yet dyd not thynke that he wold have taken them to our losse as he dyd, for beffore he had no monny to helpe us with, neyther by interest nor otherwyes, but for that bargain he fownd monny of Richard Whethylles, as it appereth by th'abstract, untyll the receyt wheroff I dyd not assuredly knowe that he wold have taken them. All is delyvered hym, v pokettes myddell Marche except, which at my returne I wyll provyde, beyng promysed at John Judde's hand to have them at reasonable pryce and dayes./The rest of our thynges. here shal be aunswered well by Godde's grace. By my letter of the xvj of this moneth I have wrytten unto youe what the payementes be which arre presently dew. Iff I can possybly practyse to cleare them within ij dayes next, I intend to tarry no lenger here, for it is necessary that I shuld be at Callais, lest in my abscens the Frenchemen shuld fall in with sum other, for at my cummyng away William Porter semed to be a seker apon sum of them. Further, if I could compase it, I wold cary home with me jCli or sumwhat more in crownes sol. and pistolettes, for with that kynd of monny better pennyworthes arre to be had of suche thynges as cum to Callais at Frenchemen's handes than otherwyes./At my cummyng from Callais I was at a poynt with none off the Frenchemen, otherwyes than that one John Gylbert of Parys offred to send wyne thyther in my name, and to gyve me a Frenche crowne for the tonne, but we concluded not. Nevertheles I thynke he wyll use my name, but he hathe promysed not to do it onles he advertys me beffore by post./From Barthylmew Warner I hoped to have hard from Parys, what he hathe done with Clawde le Prebstre and Lawrens Matont, but as yet have hard nothyng from hym sins his departure. I wyll not fayll to write unto hym offten, hopyng my letters shall have good convay by the order of one Guillamme Pol, which is my servant nowe in exchaunge of Thomas Stokes with Robart Brunel, and lyeth at Roan for our busynes, which is a handsom fellowe./I perceave howe ye have aunswered Henry Garbrant for the payement of Mychel Mulier. I shall tomorowe heare howe Michel dothe accept it, and theraffter wyll apoint to provyde for it. But off a suerty monny by interest is not to be had here at anny hand, wherffore th'exchange must be our extreme refuge, which for feare of the Marchantes Adventurours I wyll not attempt myselffe for above jCli, for I wyll none off theyr fredom if they would gyve it me. (1b)/Concernyng wares which ye arre wrytton unto for from Lynne, I wyll tomorowe ingquyer howe they arre to be had, and theroff wyll spedely advartyse youe. Ye may, iff ye thynke the proffyt suffycyent, appoint me to provyde as moche as ye shall neade, but it wold be sum rownd summe that were wourthe the cummyng hyther for, for onles I shuld occupy Michel Mulier's helpe, I must be forced to cum hyther for it./The more spedy that my cosyn Ambrose his cummyng over is, the better shall it be, for then may one of us or bothe sumtymes (if neade be) be abrode to aunswer our busynes./I cannot perssave that Michel Mulier or Pasqual de Villamonte have hyred anny ships for Spannysshe wynes, but thynke that ye have provyded in England. Pasqual shall have his letter tomorrowe, and his answer shal be sent youe with the next./Thus for this tyme I end, requyryng youe that this may make my harty commendacyons to my syster and the rest off our frendes where ye be, desyryng the Lord to preserve youe all to His pleasure./Your lovyng brother,/Richard Johnson.//Warres arre not yet proclaymed here, (1c) but the dromme goyth abowte for all those that wyll serve in shippes, to have iiij golden gr. a moneth.	sara	623210d5d862b6814e476789		xx-xx-1521	Richard	Male	Johnson			youngest sibling of the Johnson Brothers; apprentice of the company	sara		60af9ecbf038043336624b28	Johnson & Company	xx-xx-1514	John	Male	Johnson		Protestant	Merchant; draper and stapler	sara

The export of victuals was prohibited (see Letter 716), and English ships carrying such wares were arrested. They were told, however, that they would be allowed to sail for England, provided they deposited a Guarantee (that the cargo was not intended for France). The English Ambassador protested that this was a violation of the Commercial Convention between the two countries for a release to be subject to conditions, but the Queen Dowager urged the war as the reason. The Imperial Council of State upheld the decision, and said the Convention did not state that "goods purchased in one country may be transported to that country\'s enemies." Michel Mulier was a Fleming and "a fre porter" of Antwerp, and Richard hoped he could freight a cargo where he wished. (Cf. Spanish Calendar, X, pp. 371, 382).'}	Barbara	Winchester		The Johnson Letters	1953		623210d5d862b6814e476789	758.

I fownd no fault with the sending of your lettre by a hastie messinger, but the haste of the messinger I fownd fault with, for he that shuld aunswer by soche one had nede to have nothing ellis to do; and therfore for soche haste in asking aunswer to your lettres ye neade not to thancke hym, but rather will hym geve more respit when /you/ wil be aunswered to your lettres./Your clothe at Glapthorne yt may please you to use as it shall stand with your comodite, either to fet it or leave part of it ther. For if your comodite may be served, the troble of my folkes shal not be extemed, ner it is not to be accompted a trowble wher I wold pleasure shuld be showed./Yf I had bene providid of monney (as now is an evill tyme with me, all thinges considered, my adventure being abrode, and now a tyme I occupie monney for assewrans) yt had bene no trowble to have paid my oncle Worley xxli. Ye maie comande a greater thing then that if it please you, but then it came evill to passe; howbeit, shift is made and he pleased, I trust, and this xxli ye sentt now by my wif dothe aunswer it agayn./The adventure of the 1/5 parte of the ship to be laden for Lynne I perseave ye accepte, God send her safe./On Michelmes even she was not at Burdiaulx, as I perceave by lettres from Bartilmew Warner, but other shippes I freighted were: howbeit, she hathe had sins faire wyndes, and I hope she is ther./Yt restith yet in your awne pleasure whether ye will have anny adventure in the shippes I freighted for Spaigne or not, ror I am content to participate parte therof unto you if ye please. But indead I am not so dowtefull of the thing, having asseured it after vj pro cento, that I neade to be wery of my bargayne or departe with anny parte therof but unto my freinde, and so extemyng you (bycawse I know ye arre glad to further my doinges) I made you the offre tnat I did, so that bothe that and annything elles I may do is redie to my uttermoest, and so I hope ye exteme and thinck of me, even as also if ye thincke it your comodite, ye may apointe to have your monney of me hier that is payeable at Andwerpe. Howbeit, I trust ye blame me not when I write you how thinges goithe, that ye may therbie consider how to be content to make your reconyng with me, for this unsteadfastnes of thinges cawsith me to looke narrowly, as yt behowith me that I be not a loser bothe in wulles and monney, wherin yf ye thinck my frendship so slender that ye must seke other, I am sory for it, howbeit when ye have tried further ye shall better beleave that I have cawse to write as I have done; and therfore to conclude, yf ye please not to make me sochy a reconyng as the tyme shall serve, abowte that tyme ye looke to have your monney, I praie you do your pleasure, alwaies hopinge ye will consider that seing moest tymes I am not paid in Flaunders at my daie, ye wil not be precyser with me than with a marchaunt straunger./For a testymonie of the new coyne (1b) I send you ij peces, a xijd and a vjd. Ther is a pese of vs and a di. pese: George Graunt hathe the preant on a caerde to showe youe. What their valew is I knowe not: it is said vs th'once and be fyne silver. Yt is said the vjd old monney shal be called in, (2b) and this daie shuld have bene, but is not done, why God knowith.

What the matter is, God knowith, but exceding sodayn it is to all the heres. (1c)/Touching your wull untransported it makith no matter, I force not of yt. I had rather have had monney, wherunto if George Perott can helpe me he may do me pleasure at his next comyng to Callais; but elles it semeth my brother (2c) and he be no soche freindes to medle in other matters, partely for his sodayn departing last from Callis. Howbeit, my brother being now at Roan, at his returne is lyke to have soche busynes that one of them may emploie th'other if they can agre, and for my parte I praie you advertise Gorge they maie so do./I have paid Mr. Smythe vli, and aunswerd my accompte bitw/e/ne my brother Blase (3c) and me viijli, so that those your comyssiones be perfourmed./At Callais the Hollonders have done a smalle feat, but what yt is I am not yet certefied.

JOHN JOHNSON TO ANTHONY CAVE//A copie of a lettre sent/to Mr. Anthony Cave,/at Chicheleye.//Jhesus anno 1551, the 21th in October, at London//After dew and hertie comendations unto you and my awnte, with the lyke from my wif and all your freindes hier, yours of the 19th of these presentes came to me this mornyng, (1a) perseaving ye will send to Glapthorne on Fridaie, wherfore I praie you be so good to send the lettres hierinclosed to my servaunt./Yf my writing that I wold not departe unto a straunger with 300 ducattes of my adventure owt of Spaigne for xxli be the cawse ye refewse my offre, I am sory, for I ment nothing lesse then to refewse you. Indead against your mynd I advisid you not to medle: but it was not bycawse I wold not do so moche for you, ner no more I praie you take it so, yet being content to do you pleasure in that or the lyke, yf ye please to comand me./The Staple, thoughe we had a new graunt of yeres and wer at a pointe with the Counsell, (2a) provith now to small proffit to the occupiers, for of latt to the Hollanders London felles winters be sold for 18 nobles, somers countreis for 19, Kesten for 26li, Lynsaie 28li, and midell Cotes 29.5 li the serplero. This is not one mane's sale but generall to the nomber of lxx M. felles, and apon a L serplers of wulles; and it semith rather then faille men wil be content to sell better chepe, for except the Hollonders no man in manner comyth ther, which bringeth men in despeir, as also the hope of buying wulles good coveted Charter. (Cf. Rich, op cit, p.30). (See also Letters 908, 924). f chepe in Englond cawsith men to thinck that it will be better chepe the next yere. This /is it/ that I understond of the trade of the Staple, wherbie ye maie bothe consider what is best for yow in the apointing your occupieng in the same, and also ye maye perseve what reconnyng I make of your wulles remayning. Inded I maie not (if I do well) thincke but ye ment well to me in the bargain, for I am swer ye dyd so, out thus is the chaunce that wner I thought to have made myself amendes for the last yere, wherin I was a losser by th'exchaunge, now my fortune is to have as ill a bargaine or wurse./Patiens!/Yt is reason, ser, ye seke the best meanes to have home your monney ye can to your comodite, and I conseave no unkindnes therof, alwais being redie to be the best meane I can to further yow, having as good a wil to do it as those other frendes ye wrote ye wold trye, thoughe perchaunce my power and knowledge be not so good; and yet to my power I wil do what I can, and am content to apoint your monney hier in Englond as the tyme shal be when ye wold have it. Howsoever I am paid in Flaunders I will not paie yow so ill as I am paid, but then my hope is again ye will let me have a reasonable reconyng at your haundes tnen a straunger whom ye maie make your monney over with, and stand in more hassard of then ye do of me; and swerly in my fantasie (do your plesure) ye shall in nothing owte of Flaunders serve your neade so well as by your monney, for fewe in these daies proffit by wares but soche as trade 1n wares contynewally, and be costomyd; and thowghe ye thincke monney will not ryse, yet it dothe, being now at Andwerp 18s 6d and hier 19s 2d, and in my judgment yet yt will up, for now that men fynd but half the monneye they had, as daily more and more they fele it when paimentes come one their handes, it causith monney to be scant, which will cause it to ryse, Ye, when our newe comethe abrode it wil be hygher, but then I understond th'exchaunge shal be at lybertie, leest elles it ronne over the se apase./The nomber in the Tower incresithe, but the Lord Pagett (1b) is not ther as it was said. The Counsaill have geven the Lord Maior to understond the causis to be as followithe: that the Dwke of Summersette hathe practised to get the Tower of London, wher he wold have brought the Kyng, and then have rewled the Kinge's realme as pleasid hym; also that he wold have had the Yle of Wyght, wher he wold have fortifyed; also that he practysed to get the Great Seale, that nothing shuld passe proclamation nor other but soche as he plesid; and fowerthlye he wold have made an insurrectyon and ben in the coffers of ryche men of London./Tnis is openyd in all our halles hier in London /and to/ the hole commons. I beseche God be mersifull to us, and send an agrement, and that our noble King may be preserved. (1c)/For shepe be they cullinges, ewes so they be yong, or lambes that be good, I refferr me unto yow, desiering yow to spare me so many as ye can, for that I wold fain mend my bread. I have none but good in a paster I paie rent for.

What awnswer I shalt have I knowe not, but yf ye will nevertheles have a ship freighted, I will write it shal be done, and wil be content to lade with you the one half, supposing that hoppes being at viijs Fl. the hondreth, yron and hering wil be the best ware we can occupie; howbeit, at Lynne we shal be trowbled with Master Hering, for ther they will compell us to serve the towne. Yf ye be fully myndid in these thinges, it maie please you to write me, and will do for you as for myself in all thinges, supposing that Lynne is a better poort for you then Boston bycawse of your convey to Saint Yves, which is meat for your countre. I praie you write by your next youre holle mynd, and I will in all thinges do that I may, refferring anny further writting therof untyll I have your aunswer./Robert Andrew is apointed to go hens to Andwerp the next weke. Hierwith is a lettre from hym: yf ye send aunswer after he is gone, it shal be conveyd unto hym./I praie you, let shepard have soche shepe as he lykith best /of/ those ye write of, and I will please you for them, hertely thancking you ye will let me have those that be good. I wil be glad to requite it yf it laie in my power./Tne other matters remeyne as before yt is said. The hangman of Callais is other comme or sent, and it is thought by some they shal not come to arraynement. (1b)/New monney is still coygnyng, and it is thought shall abrode shortely. Monney is at xixs ijd, and if that be abrode it wil be above xxs, for the pese of fyve shellinges ys better then the daler. Thus I must and, having lytle tyme and your messinger hasty. /I/ praie you to take this hastie skribling in good wourthe./Master Butler's monney for his wagon, as I remember, was geven the new tollener of Gravelinge. How it standes I knowe not, but our wagons Robert Brunell writes be made, and shal be sent us shortely./I thanck you for my wanton wenche Faithe. Ye shall receyve a gowne for her, and iij more for my cossens./Yours at all tymes,/John Jonnson.	sara	60af9ecbf038043336624b28	Johnson & Company	xx-xx-1514	John	Male	Johnson		Protestant	Merchant; draper and stapler	sara		60ed97bf55947e60cc7375ed			Anthony	Male	Cave		Protestant	Draper and merchant of the Staple in Buckinghamshire; friend of John's father; John was apprenticed to him	sara

AMBROSE SAUNDERS TO JOHN JOHNSON//Anne 1551, the 29 in October, at Callais.//Youres of the 16, 18 and 19 of this present were this mornyng at x of the clocke delyvered me per Richard of my lorde his sellor. For answer to your first in effect is for the not answering of Alsop his byll per Thomas Maye at Andwerp: Sir, even as my cosyn Richard dyd advertyse you, so dyd he leave me remembrance that he had lefte order with Cnristofer Johnson and Thomas Maye to take Mychell Mulier his helpe in provysyon for hym, John Fizwilliams and John Burnell. Your lettre ys old, and therfore I hope you be sens advertysed of the clearing of the same byll to Alsop, cont 551i 0s 0d./The rest of your said lettre dothe but rate us bothe for lacke of diligence. I wold I cowld answer your lettres before I receave them: ye make me afrayd to look on your lettres, chyding withowt a cawse, consyderyng my /do/ing in Flaunders as you do understond; and know yf ye will nowe I brawle after my fassyon, but take yt in worthe I pray you./Your advyse for monney I will follow, but yeat I dare not be bold, and lykewyse your counsaill and my cosyn Richard his lettre I will folowe to the best of my power. Unto Mr. Warner I will send his lettres tomorrow, and wryte hym of the state of the worlde here./Your ship which you have freighted shall I hope be laden even according to your charterpartie; howbeyt, the fault /of/ this ser/van/t of Glaud will hynder us moche, for I know not hof/w to/ have monney, having not yeat reconed with the Hol/landers/. We will shift, by the grace of God; and for your advyse for our charterparties, we have alredye begone the same order, and by God His helpe we will worke as warely and subtilly as we can devyse./Your ij lettres of the 15 and 19 unto my cosyn Johnson I have receyved, and redd them according to your desyre; which for the most part ys alltogeather brawling, which I wold myght seace except more occasyon on my part then justly I can confesse. And as for the slacke answering of your debtis at Andwerp, I will by Gode's grace wryte this daye, even as I have alredy done, to Mychell Mulier and Cnristofer Johnson, declaring our saelles and th'occasyon that we cannot presently make them monney, which is for bycawse we have not nor yeat can recon with the Hollonders. And for the shyft to be made for 400li for Mychell Mulier the first of the next, the tyme ys so short that I cannot do yt, not only for bycawse we have not the Hollonders' bylles, but also bycawse our monney ys not due untill tne xth of December; and even so dyd I thincke my cosyn Richard had enlarged you, for so was his saying unto me at my retourn from owt of Flaunders: he shewed me he had wryton you of the hole syrcumstaunce. I will do all that I can for the contentement of Mulier, first by fayre wordis and after with monney, with as moche spede as I can possyble, hoping all shall be well./The 38 serplers wull that my cosyn your brother wrot you of were new, so that we have 38 pockettes old to be deducted owt of them, wherin I warrant you we have no favour neyther in the pryses nor dayes, but even at the worst that may be./Thus moche the 29 October in, the mornyng, fynyshed the 30./Consydering the olde date of your lettre, I was forsed to suppose the craer to be at Dunquerke which you have fraighted, bycawse she is not yeat comen hether; <nerfore I have bene this daye their, and perceave also that she ys not comen thether, which is the better for us and wold nowe, yf yt might be, that she were discharged, forasmoche as this /daye/ at ll of the cloke the defens was proclaymed at Dunq/uerke/, which is even so straight as I have wryton you in my l/a/s/t/. And theirfore yf anny more travaill shal be in these newe matters, as ye call it verey often, and still burthen me with negligent looking to your busynes for these new matters, as thowgh I were the occasyon of the evill answering of your bylles at Andwerp and never had the charge theirof, I saye yf annything more shal be done therin I se no shift but by saulf-conduct, which I thincke will not be had withowt some frende's letter to the Regent and Chamberlain (1c) being nowe with her./Our shippis be this daye at none departed with a fair sowtwest wynd and well appoynted, the Lorde spede them./Your ij lettres of the 21 and 22 I receyved this none tyde, with a lettre for Thomas Maye which I will send hym tomorrow, and wryte hym even as before I have done, which is according to your mynd. And with as moche spede as I can possyble I will followe myselfe, but first I must recon with the Hollonders, and make all clear for our old wulles, which yf I can I will dispatche tomorrowe, and depart on Sondaye; and at my comyng their will performe all your comyssyons the best I can./I perceave you have subskrybed our bylles to Thomas Egerton, and that you do looke for advise, which I do not understond, for I am sure ye know the parcelles that we have bawght bothe of wulles and felles, by my cosyn Richarde's lettre; which yf you do not ye maie /in/ tyme ynowgh hereafter be advertised from me theirof, having nowe no tyme, etc./Whether your brother be at Rouen or not, God knowith, for I have not yeat hard fram hym. I will God willyng wryte to hym of my brother Blase's matter for the prises of Vitery canvas, and lykewyse to know what credict he maye have theirfore./Yt dothe moche greve me that you be still complayned unto for th'answering of your busynes in Flaunders. I will to my power sorow for the reformation theirof, and no new matter that I know of shall move me to gyve you occasyon to do that you are lothe to do, as in youres of the 22 ye wryte. Whatsoever ye will do, yeat I pray you burthen not /me/ with another man's fault, and thincke the matter ................ on my part as your awne, for assuredly his ................... was that all your busynes was in good order .............. your bylles payeable the xxjth of the next, by Gode's grace, shal be acept/id/ and cleared, as appertaigneth. I will care therefore, but I cannot care for thinges I know not of; theirfore be not moved with me for your former matters, I pray you./John Mate hathe yeat advaunsed no more monney to our accompt then I have wryton you in my former, wherfore I have wryton my cosyn Richard that yt ys no reason Saquevile showld be halfe with us in gaynes, except a further good tourne, for he hathe not performed his promes, as his bargayne was with us: but assuredly I recon not the fault to be in hym, for I am assured his comyssyon was larger then hathe bene performed. Knaves wil be knaves, etc./I dyd lately wryte you that I wold attempt our freind Richard Nycholles, customer of Dover, to make us soche a certyfycatt as we showld at anny tyme devyse for our helpis under the seall of his office; and this present daye I have receyved his answer, and he ys contented to do as we shall appoynt hym at anny tyme, so he maye do us pleasure and profytt hymselfe, as in my former I have wryton, which ys vs apon every last heringe, etc. This frendshipp is worthy thanckes, and will be good to put in ure, I thincke./Yf I shall sue for anny saulfe-conduct, procure me some man's lettre to Mr. Chamberlen (1d) to be our good master./I have this daye sent a serpler Barkes to Jasper Balthaser of Delf, at 38li st. ta., payeable at Shrovetyde, and will helpe awaye the rest as I may to the best, requiering your counsaill as ye shall thincke good./Thus I rest for this tyme, and comytt you to God, Who contynu your good helthe, with my syster and your family./Your loving brother,/Ambrose Saunders./j The cawse why Hadebault doth staye 30li is for a pockett Barkes retourned the 8 in August which is not yeat visyted, and he hathe not deposed, so that untill he have sent his deposytion I cannott send another, as ye know.

Touching your writing and frendly advise geven me for my quietnes, I did not take it in yll parte, but moest hertely thancke you for it; howbeit, I being entred apon soundre occasions into soundre trades of occupieng, which provokyth me to followe it in soche soirte as I cannot be so quiet as your will and advise is to have me, and indead being entred as before is said, I must nedes followe it, and so by Gode's help I purpose to do; contenting myself with my calling, whiche so quietly as I can I will followe; desiring you therfore, Sir, to beare me your goodwill as ye have done in all my doinges, and to my power I wil be youres as I have bene./And if without your unquietnes ye please to sealle my obligations to Mr. Doylie, I shall desier you to do it, and I will be bound unto you again in obligatin, and will desier my brother Richard and Ambrose (1a) to be bound unto you with me; but if this shuld be anny cawse to unquiet you now in the tyme of your age and wekenes, or elles to bringe myself into anny other bond, I wil not desier it in nowise, for I wold not have my freind be unquieted for me; and therfore if I can by no other meane satisfie Mr. Doylie (as I wrote you before) I will fynd meanes to repaie hym his monney, which I praie you to accompt no earnestnes ner nothing elles that I write, for I will by my will trowble no man more then I may have with veary goodwill and quietnes./Mr. Lovet declared his mynd not to be to lett his howse, but with the lease to deliver xlli, to have a ton of wyne for it. Indead so I lyked not the bargayne, but to have geven a di. tonne or what elles ye will promise for me, I was_and am content, thincking ye wold not promes I shuld geve him a tonne of wynne for his xlli, and os yet I am content to do as ye please to make the bargayne, thancking you for the travaille ye have taken./I am sory your clothe was so evill used at Glapthorne.

AMBROSE SAUNDERS TO JOHN JOHNSON//Laus Deo./Anno 1551, this present 25 in November, at Callais. (1a)//Youres of the 19 came to my haundes this present mornyng, and do well understond your tauntis, which might well ynowgh be left owt. I will not saye anny more that I am werye to looke on your lyke lettres, but truly I will leave answering amny more yf ye contynu in burthenyng me with other men's faultis, saying that alwayes evill messengers chaunce to have the carryeage of Richard Johnson's lettres and myne, as thowghe I showld fayne the sending of lettres and not wryte at all, as I have harde you saye ye judged of hym; which on my part ys not treuth, God the auctour of treuth to wyttnes. I wold - and will as willingly as ye sytt up nightes, rather then thinges showld be unanswered./Consernyng the contentes of your former I have well consydered, howbeyt the state of our reconyng ys soche that I promes you I cannot go owt of the towne conveniently to do annything, except I showld gyve men occasyan of suspection, which ys easy to do, etc.; pourposyng not to travayle abowt hering as yeat, and even so dothe Mychell Mulier advyse me, consydering your further charging of me contynually. Not yeat do I here of youres to Edmond Wogan, payeable here the 19 of this monneth as you wryte, cont. 941i 3s 4d; and one to Arnold Peltis, payeable the 20 of the next, cont. 95li. My provysyon for the same shal be to the best of my power, and to most proffytt, but I am sory ye arr compelled to charge me with so moche, trusting you do well understond that all that ys growyng of our saelies will not serve our tourn, althowgh ye wryte I maye make shyfte therwith./I perceave my cosyn Richard wil be at Callais shortly, which I am right glad of, wysshing with all my hart that he were here, for then might one of us be in the countrey abowt other affayres whyles th'other contynued here, at the least for the contentement of our credettours' eyes, which ys necessarye surely./Having wrytton thus moche of this lettre, I had knowleage of the comyng of a post, and expectyng other newis from you and more comfortable, I repayred unto hym, and their found, youres of the 20 of this present, perceaving the good delivery of myne of the 12 and 13, which I am glad of, althowgh my former be not delyvered./For answer, knowe ye tnat ymedyatly I repayred to Christofer Johnson to shewe hym th'abuse of your accompt, howbeyt suppose rather he to be in the right then ye, for where ye thinke to have allowaunce of 227li which you were charged with to paye at London, the 204li 8s 4d which is allowed you in Christofer Johnson's abstract ys even the verey same as by the reconyng and tyme of deliverey aperith, and I am sure you will sone fynd yt when ye looke in your abstractes, which Robert Andrew hathe delyvered you; wherfore I wryte no more theirof, being owt of anny hope of helpe of that some./And whereas ye thincke to be made credettour for 90li which my cosyn Johnson receyved of Nycholas Wheler, and that you have allowed the same unto Thomas Hunt: Sir, my said cosyn your brother must allowe yt unto you, for he neyther paid the same to Sir Raphe Warren his servant, nor to Christofer Johnson, but tooke yt home with hym at his departeur sayeth Christofer Johnson; and even yt semeth rather then otherwyse, for dnythinge that I fynd in his remembraunce lefte with Cnhristofer Johnson, whatsoever he hathe wryton unto you. Tne matter semethe verey playne yf this be treu, which I know not but by Christofer Johnson his report, marvayling that he showld wright he had paid the same to Sir Raphe Waren his servant, for, saithe Christofer, the same monney being in dallers, he chaunged it for gold for ease in carryeage. Thus are we so moche unfurn/is/hed more then you do expect./Also, where ye saye their was monney due by /D/aniell van den Heede and Phillip Mahue in September, wherof ye se no reconyng, the 78li 10s 3d which Christofer Johnson chargeth hymselfe with as redy monney, by Richard Johnson his assingnacion to Wolfe Busner, ys Danielle's debt, and Phillip Mahu his byll was one of the iij which were solde to Robert Andrew the xxviijth in July last past, viz. one due by John Mahue the last in September, cont. 378li 0s 0d Fl., idem one due the Last of November, cont. 235li 4s, and one other due by Hubert Bullens the last September and last October, cont. 148li 8s 0d, some totalles 761li 12s 0d, and sold for 742li 12s 0d, by meanes wherof proceded your foote of accompt appering in Christofer Jonnson his abstract, cont. 138li 15s 5d at the making up of the same the 16 in August./Thus ye maye perceave I am not more troubled then I nede, althowgh I had had information, which I cowld not have. But for the good ending of this great charge, assure yourselfe I will not only tarry to se th'end therof, but practyse the same to the best of my power. But marvayle not thowgh I be abasshed.

God knowith what shall happen./To Jemis Harvey I have paid 209li 2s 8d for the clearing of Mr. Ofley his bylles, but have not agreed with hym for th'interest which he demaundethe for the whole tyme. At xij on the C I trust to agre with hym to your contentation: yt ys reason and for our honesties to please hym./John Burnelle's billes, John Alsopis debt, and Richard Johnson's debt of Lli to Smythe of Callais be also cleared, with your bill of exchaunge due to Antony Edelme the 20 of this present, cont. 95li 16s 8d, and also 28li 0s 0d to Thomas Dalton for old wul for our saelles to the Hollonders, and to Mychell Mulier I hav paid also 380li. These be the paymentes hether unto made. I pray God the rest maye as well be compassed, etc./In my last I wrote you of the shipping of 100 peces Rota raysyns in John Robyn, master of the Pellycan, who hathe deseaved me, and hathe not taken in anny more then L peces. The rest of the 100, and also 50 peces more, I have shipped in Gyllys Johnson of this towne, master of a hoye of the burthen of 80 tunes, named the Nycolas of Andwerp, and for the freight of every of the same pecis you must paye vd, as by their bookis aperith./All kynd of wares dothe ryse daylie here, and our nation be so hastie in buying, and have taken so moche that the towmesmen do thincke they will never come ageane, and saye no lesse openly./From Dunquerke I here nothing, wherat I marvaille, but do wryte daylie as occasyon requerith. What ys done their I know not, and to go thether I may not, but wold gladly, God knowith. Saulfe-conduct ys largely graunted, but after soche sorte as no man dothe yeat medell. The auventure ys so great, and the lykelodd of proffytt so small that no good ys to be done: for so moche as a man will send owt, he must paye 8 pour cent comptant, according to the pryce of his thinges bawgnt; and for wynes brawght hether, or other comodites, a pryce shall be sett, which men shall not passe apon paigne of forfayteur of corps et bienes. This I here, supposyng Mychell Mulier hathe more largelier done you to understond the matter./100 of the pieces raysyns cost after lls 6d the C waight, and the rest at 9s. God send them saulf arryvall, and then dispatche them all togyther, per adviz de Mychell Mulier. God send you proffytt that I be not rebuked, I mean, that I be not dyscoraged ageanst another tyme./Th'exchaunge is nowe at 17s 4d, and suppose yt will come to 16s and under. The scarsetie of monney contynueth, which grevith me. I pray God send us some good measnes for the dyspatche of your affayres that I maye be at home this Christemas, for I thincke yt mete for every honest marryed man to repeir home ons in a quarter, etc./From Perot I receyved a lettre iij dayes past, who willed me full dyscretly (his lettre being wryton at Callais the 20th) that I showld mete hym at Dunquerke the 24 for the understonding of his procedinges at Bullen, wherof I know nothinge for lacke of advyse. But yf I dyd, yt ys not necessary I showld depart, except Richard Johnson were here, or some man to aunswer your affaires en persone, for I do well perceave yt ys a great contentement to men, and otherwyse (except diligent order) moche suspection dothe ensue. By all meanis do I practise saelles, but cannot geat anny redy monney except to great losse. God send you some good mean in Englond for to helpe ageanst these great paymentes, which shal be the 20 of the next and theirabowtes, for th'exchaunge will surely apaire for the use of yt by other meanis then our monney proceding of saelles at Callais./Thus I rest, commytting you to God, Who blesse us with His most mercyfull blessing, for ever, Amen./Skrybled/By your loving brother,/Ambrose Saunders.//Add.

RICHARD JOHNSON TO JOHN JOHNSON//Jhesus, at Andwerpe, the vij in Januarii, 1552//Affter my moest harty commendacyons, this shall advertyse youe that my cummyng hyther was the v day off this moneth, and meatyng with my cosyn Ambrose at Bruges, stayed there ij dayes in hope to have brought hyther newes off the release of our ship with wynes, which is stayed in Seland, as by his lettre written youe from Bruges I trust ye have perceyved. I do not yet heare of the release of the same, but hope that my cosyn hathe by this tyme prevayled in his sute, so that the release of the sayed wynes and sale also shal be shortly (which God graunte)./The state of our busynes here I perceyve by my cosyn Ambrose's remembrans gyven me at Bruges, and also by my conferryng with Robert Andrew sins my cummyng hyther, which shal be prosecuted accordyngly to the best off my power./I prey youe understand that all bylles of exchange dew unto this day arre clered, except Martin de Have his bylies of the xxij and xxiiij of the last, which John de la Faile hathe hitherto frendly forborne, but must by sum meanes be clered within ij dayes./At my beyng at Bruges my cosyn and I sold unto Daniel van den Hede v serplers midell Cottes at xxviijli xs, V serplers midell Barkes at xxvijli xs, and v serplers Lynsaie at xxviijli; the one moytie to be paid at di. Lent, and the other moytye at Whitsontyde. Better we could not do, and consyderyng our present necessyte here, and that we thought his bylles so currant here that we myght at all tymes helpe ourselves with them, it semed better unto us to practyse that way than otherwyes; anny other meane skantly beyng to be fownd, forasmoche as the lyke skarsetye of monny hathe not bene sene here of a great tyme./The Leithner's payment was never so bad as it is nowe, for bothe theyr bylles arre yet unpaid, and the knave theyr factour here, named John Sawtrell, not beyng contented with the staying of our monny, is also at defyans with us whan we aske it. I have this day written to Martyn Johnson into Holland of his honest demeanour towardes us; and yet we arre not alone, for all other arre lyke used as his hand./Our ware for Lynne is in redynes, but nothyng yet shipped. My cosyn I am suer hathe written youe off the commaundment which Mr. Governour dyd gyve hym to stay, and that he graunted therunto for x dayes. Those dayes arre nowe allmost expyred, and then I will not fayle to shippe, let Mr. Gouvernour say or do what he lyst. (1b)/At my cummyng from Callais I wrote unto Mr. Warner that I had disbursed to Tade Lestrilles ijC crownes sol. for Lestonacke's servant, which I requyred hym to write youe of. The same monny I had of Clawde le Prestre's servant, and must employ the lyke somm: as he shall appoint me in these partyes. I could not provyde anny monney at the Cumpannye's handes accordyng unto your appointment, to be repaid by youe at London, and therfore was forced to seke it at the sayed Philip's hand./I have this day accepted a byll of Barthyllmew Warner's to Thomas More, cont 91li 5s 0d, and payeable the xxij of the next; and by my cosyn his remembrans I perceyve there arre more dewe the viij of this moneth, and the iij and iiij of the next to Jheronimo Peperarii and John de la Faile, per iij bylles, 278li 6s 8d; which arre all the bylles of exchange payeable which I yet knowe off, hopyng that ye shall have no occasyon to charge us further with anny bylles of cxchange, which I do hartely wysshe, for we arre yet sore burdened, havyng nere vCli dewe and shortly to be dewe to Mr. Warren, Mr. Judde and other for old wull and wull bought, as by an abstract hierin (if tyme wyll serve) shall appere, besydes iiijCli dewe to Robert Andrew for Mr. Cave, and that which he hathe disbursed, and more then ijCli to Michel Mylier./I prey youe, shewe Barthylmew Warner that Raymond Tyssandyer wyll not pay the 61li for Bonshome d'Orbe onles he have his byll, which is in Nicholas Culverwelle's handes as he sayeth; and towchyng the lynnen clothe which Bonsome dyd write unto hym to delyver me, he sayeth that he knowith not what it meaneth, onles it be for certain cloth which, as he remembreth, a yong man of Gascoign had of the sayed Bonsomme's, which Gascoign is nowe in Skotland. This is all that Raymond sayeth, and I suppose it all to be cavyllacyons, intendyng so long as the warre lasteth to have th'occupying of his monny./My cosyn Ambrose hathe provyded L last of heryng to send into Fraunce, and by Bystrate's appointment I shall have xxvij last here, and xxvij last at Dunquerk, all to be shipped for Roan; but the charges off safe-conduyt arre x gyldens and xvj stuvers pour le last, which must be paid argent comptant at the Court. Howe to furnysshe the same I yet knowe not, beyng so bare of monny aS we nowe arre.

Et touchant que aves interest de tenir vostre argent si longement la, c'est bien raison que j'aie regarde, et suis bien content de vous satisfaire comme de raison en tout; neantmoins, puis que la chose est venu amon perte, et par moyen de larrons et la fortune de la mere, et point par necligenc, je vous prie soies favorable en ce que poures./J'entens que aves ayde mon frere Ambrose d'echepter 30 leestz de hareneq pour envoier a Lynne, et 50 lestz pour Fraunce, et que aves donne vostre lettre pour paiement./Je suis fort tenua vous que aves volu donne vostre lettre pour nous, et soies asseure que ne porteres d'interest en riens que aves faict, ne en ce que feres pour moy ou pour aulcune aultre en mon nom, vous promitant par cest et me obligen de accomplier tout pas feres pour mon freres Ambrose et Rychart comme s'il estoit pour moymesmes en persone, car nous faisons tout ensamble./Et en case qu'il vous plaira d'avoir Robert Andrew, mon amy, de signer aulcune cedules avecque vous pour moy, je luy ay escript de le faire, et suis asseure qu'il ne refeusera de le faire./Le navire de Lynne est arrive en Anvers comme j'entens par vostre lettres.

Neantmoins nous vous remersions bien fort de vostre voloir de faire plaisir en acheptant pour nous en Zeland, en case qu'il nous sambleroit avoir proffit./Le facteur de Jois Schore n'a point encore presente vostre lettre de 100li, mais il sera paie, soies asseure./Je suis emarveille qu'il y a telle difference de chaunge ichi et en Anvers, car il a valu ichi xviijs et pour l'huere guerre m'avis./Touchant canevais ou toilles de Rouen, je trouveraie bien moyen cest foire de faire achepter cest foire de Chandeleur par une home qui a bon entendement en telles choses, et pourtant me poures escripre avecque le premier combien que voles que nous acheptons, et sommes content de faire tout en vostre nomme, et vous aures la moictie./Et pourtant je vous prie faictes que nous pourons avoir credit a Rouen pour autant qu'il vous samblera bon, et nous ferons pareillement pour vostre part affin de avoir credit de ung an ou 2 demy-ans.

RICHARD JOHNSON TO JOHN JOHNSON//Jhesus anno 1552, the xv in January, at Andwerpe.//Affter my moest harty commendacyons (beloved brother), my last was sent hens the x of this moneth by one Anthony Crede, one which cam this way from Venys. My trust is that the same is cum unto your handes./I have lyttell matter to write unto youe more then I therin wrote, but that ye shall hierwith receyve the estate which I fownd our busynes in at my cummyng hyther, wherby ye shall perceave that we yet arre and lyke shortly to be at a greate affterdeale of our accompt here. By the syght therof, my hope is ye wyll conceave sum spedy provysyon necessary for the furnyture theroff here (or at the leestway for parte of it) from London: for undowtedly there is no reconnyng to be made of anny monney to be had eyther by interest or for anny of those bylles which be here dewe of day to cum, for in the sale of Danyell van den Hede's byll I have bene so trowbled as I never was the lyke, beyng forced (besydes the payment of unreasonable interest) to be Art van Dale's man to gether in his debtes, abowte the which havyng trudged these iiij dayes past, yet have I 130li to receave of my byll cont. 280li; and remedy is there none but so to do or ellis to go withowte monny, for the fowle carle wold not tell me one penny owte of his howse. Other bylles he wyll buy none, and monny is so skant here in other men's handes that I can perceyve no shyffte to be made with our bylles, but that we shal be forced to tarry our dayes, in the meanetyme not knowyng howe to cleare our instant payementes, but trust honestly to content all men (as they have hytherto bene, God be praysed) by one meane or other. The lyke skarsytye of monny hathe not bene sene in this towne, for ........... cownter in it is not ashamed to pay a moneth ........... as moche shal be done as in me lyeth .................. your contentacyon. I wysshe ye wold ............... by th'exchange tyll monny be here better ................. to /a/unswer it then by rechange wyl be very hard to be fownd./My cosyn Ambrose his suyt for our wynes I perceave is not yet ended, the Lord graunt hym good successe in it./All men arre nowe unburdened of the payement of the di. pour cent, but it is feared that the discharge of so lyght a burthen wyll turne to a greater yoke to the Emperour's subjectes pour le moins, God kepe our nacyon fre from it and all other./The Mary Fortune of Lynne is not yet laden, but provysyon is made for her ladyng, and so sone as she is rygged shal be laden by Godde's grace. It hathe not chaunced evyll that she is yet to lade, for the great stormes which have bene here of late have put her in great jeopardy of wracke, lying at the kay, but thankes be to God she hathe escaped the daunger of synkyng, which xxiij hoyes and crayers lying at the wharfes here have sustayned. Apon Wednesday last was here the most terryble storme that ever I hard or sawe. The water, overflowyng most stretes in this towne, hathe brought downe nere xx howses standyng on the royes; the wynd hathe blowen downe chymneys, pynacles and gable endes, and sum howses downe to the ground; the thonder hathe burnt one parte of Barrowe, the water hathe drowned another with all the madder ground, and also hathe overflowen Romerswale Barke and other groundes thereby. Into Flaunders the sea also broken, and is xiiij fadom depe in the breche, /and/ x fadom in dyvers partes of the land./Zeland h/athe/ escaped at this tyme (God be praysed ther/fore/)./We have bought iron for xxxix stuvers di. the C, for lyke dayes of payement as the last was bought, wherin is cont. xv M. for Mr. Cave, which and v last of herryng ye may recon as parcell of the ijCli paid to Robert Andrew for my sayed master; and those ij parcelles wyll make nere jCli, which is good towardes the state of our affaires here./Pitche we have bought for xix gr. di., and tarre for xviij gr.

Raysyns of Malega, sackes and bastardes, Michel Mulier hymselfe wyll furnysshe, trustyng within iiij dayes the ship shal be laden, and redy to take the next fayre wynd./Iff we were not to moche charged here, moche good were to be done, for herryng is nowe to be bought for xjli which cowld not be had for xiijli, and lower wyll it be, for the Frenche Kyng wyll graunt no saulf-conduict. I wyll assay what I can do, and iff my compasse fayle me not I hope to get a good porcyon into my handes, but the myschiefe is to want monny to pay for the charges of the safe-conduict, which must be paid at th'obteynyng of it./He which wold have bargsyned with us for wulles to have taken his jewell; (1c) hathe sent to me sins I cam to towne, and yet is wyllyng to be doyng.

RICHARD JOHNSON TO JOHN JOHNSON//Jhesus, at Andwerp, the xx in Januarii, 1552.//Affter harty commendacyons (beloved brother) my last is of yesterdaye's date and bownd hierwith. (1a) And for aunswer of your ij letters, one to my cosyn and another to me, I prey youe understand that whereas ye wryte that I answer those thynges I lyke not with scylens, the trueth is that unto certain of your letters writton unto me, conteynyng that all thynges here had bene dysordred by me, I thought better not to answer than to have contended by writyng; and as I take it, it was better to kepe scylens then to exscuse that which I knewe ye wold not accept, allthoughe I had bene well able to defende that the disorder cam not by me: but iff my order had bene observed, my cosyn Ambrose had not neaded to have complayned by, wrytyng as he hathe done, nor yet (beyng as it was) to have made so great an exclamacyon of that which he cannot prove; but God be praysed (by his good order) that matter is redressed, and so I hove shall contynew to your contentacyon, which God graunt./Further, whereas I am burdened shamefully to have handled Michel Mulier for his heryng, allthoughe the reproche be sumwhat grevous yet I am glad it is causeles, even as your suspycyon that there arre no wynes lefft for our accompt is nedeles (God be thanked therfore), for at Roan I shipped for our accompt in John Marshe of Callais xxij1/2 ton of wyne, and in Thomas Perkyn of Rochester xxxvj ton j pece; also for Henry Garbrante's accompt I shipped there in William Goodlake of Lyghe xx tonne, and in Rowland Piers of Callais xxxix tonne di., all the which, God be praysed, arryved at Callais in safetye. And from thens I sent xxix tonne di. for our accompt to Myddleborowe, and delyvered Henry Garbrmt his wyne at Callais, which never was unladen there (as oures was) but by hym one ship sent into Seland and the other to Dunquerque, where (I meane in Seland) he and we arre in trowble for them, as I am suer ye arre before advertysed, God send us a good end of our sutes there./I wyll write of this matter sumwhat largely, bycawse I wold ye shuld understand the hole matter, wherunto ye may gyve credyt if ye so thynke good, assuryng youe that ye shall hereby perceave the hole truthe, the which havyng wayed with yourselfe I trust wyll cawse youe to judge me not fawtworthye. By Henry Garbrante's commyssyon he wylled me to sell for hym (as I wold for myselfe) xx last of herryng, referryng the takyng of wynes for it or otherwyes to my discression, onles I could have met with one Robert Yon of Parys, to whome he wylled me to delyver so moche herryng as wold contervayle a debt of his to the sayed Yon; which Yon was not in Roan duryng my beyng there. Havyng occasyon to go to Newehaven, at which tyme herryng was wourthe but 124 frankes the last, and fearing that the noumber which was dayly loked for at Roan wold cawse the price to fall, it semed best to me to take a good offer whan it was proffred, which was 130 frankes for a last of herryng, and to take wynes at 40 frankes the tonne, which I dyd, thynkyng I dyd well in advancyng vj frankes in a last more then other were then sold for. The ship arryved not in iij wekes affter, and then the maryner delyverd but xvij last, havyng sold the other iij last (as he sayed) for 120 frankes, and lykewyes x barrelles of Mr. Hewettes./I durst not stryve with hym, forasmoche as he was to privy whose the goodes were, but his promys was to delyver to me or to my assignes in Roan so moche herryng of the lyke marke at Candlemas, wherwith I was forced to be contentyd, retayning his freight and average in my handes./The accompt of the sayed herryng and wynes I have delyvered to Henry Garbrant, wherin I am suer he wyll not say that he is begyled of one farthyng, and God I take to wytnes I dyd for them in this matter so moche as my dyscressyon dyd leade me unto, beyng assured (that if this unhappy chaunce had not bene in Seland) they shuld have bene great gayners by theyr wyne, the same beyng (by Henrye's owne confessyon) the best that he tasted this yeare. And moche do I marvayll that they wyll write of that, wherof neyther Henry nor Michel have sayed one word unto me (I meane) of fyndyng fault with my doynges: only they marvayled that I wrote not unto them, which I dyd not apon this occasyon, that is, that at Muttrel dyvers Englysshe letters were opened, and if the lyke had chaunsed by anny of myne wherin I had written concernyng theyr matters, I myght have brought myselfe in suche trowble as (I feare) they wold have lefft me in; and whereas they write they never hard from me tyll Henry Garbrant cam to Callais, I am suer if that were to write they wold write otherwyes nowe, for Henry receyved, beyng at Callais, a letter which I had sent hym to Lisle, and Michel Mulier receyved a letter from me by a man off Armentiers, whome he directed to me by his leiser off credyt. Thus moche have I discoursed unto youe of my dealyng with Michel Mulier which hathe bene soche that they neade not to be offended mor arre not so farre as I can perceyve, and therfore I existeme my reproche the lesse; and wysshe that when my cosyn Ambrose dothe the lyke busynes for them, he may do it to theyr contentacyon, wheroff I shal be glad, and not redy to make the thyng wurs then it is, as by his letters to youe I perceave he hathe done this and other matters to./But this shall suffyse for this tyme, hopyng that brotherhode shall not be broken for this matter, but do trust the bond of it shal be strengthened, wherunto of my parte I wyll endevour myselfe to the uttermost of my power, so that my doynges shal be to your contentacyon, which the Lord graunt, Amen./Whereas ye write there arre not 6 serplers clyffte wull lefft in Callais, I do not take it to be so, for we have more Kesten lefft than that noumber. I have written youe before of all the sales that we have made, trustyng the same is cum to your handes before this./I mystrust not but so to content Clawde le Prebstre and other that we have to do with that it shal be to theyr contentacyon. I perceave that I am loked for by them at Callais. If I could practyse by anny meanes to make monny to discharge our debtes here present ahd to cum, I wold not be long here, but that wyll I perfourme before my goyng hens, by Godde's grace. Michel Mulier is determyned not to medle with anny canvas for Spayn, dnd therfore it is nedeles to write to Sakkeville or Bistrate for that matter./I trust Mr. Master hathe his canvas from Roan before this tyme, and thereby is contented. I wyll advertyse hym what his iron cost, but the lynnen clothe which was bought for hym was bought here. by youe, and for annythyng that I can remember I dyd not knowe the prices of it, but at my cummyng home I shall loke for it and write unto hym. By this tyme I hope the herryng for Lynne is redy shipped, and that the ship wyll take the next fayre wynd. Parte of the rest for Fraunce I thynke is also shipped, but may not depart before we have paid x gyldens and xvj stuvers pour last at the Cowrt, off which monny we arre yet unfornysshed. God send us sum provysyon for that and other our necessary affayres here, for I thynke it not mete to put in suertys here to bryng certificat hyther of the sale of it in England, for it were the next way to undo our frendes which shuld be suertyes for it, and to bannysshe us the countrey./He which sold Michel Mulier's herryng is named William Sergeant, and dwelleth at Ratclyff. Richard Bond was only master and medled with nothyng. I lefft at Cellais with Perrot his chartrepartye, and his demand of average, which or the copye theroff I write unto hym to send youe. Herryng hathe bene sold sins for 138 frankes, but there can be no more demanded of hym then I sold for, which is 130 frankes a last.//Rest missing/.	sara	623210d5d862b6814e476789		xx-xx-1521	Richard	Male	Johnson			youngest sibling of the Johnson Brothers; apprentice of the company	sara		60af9ecbf038043336624b28	Johnson & Company	xx-xx-1514	John	Male	Johnson		Protestant	Merchant; draper and stapler	sara

I have thought good therfore to write unto you these fewe lynes, and to certifie you that if ye do reteyne anny of my goodes and so becomme your awne judge, ye do me wrong, and ye shal be assewred that I wil not suffre it at your haundes, etc. But if ye will apoint your matter to be indifferently hard, wher nether you ner I shall be our awne judges, I shall be content, for reason is meat to rule us bothe; wherunto if ye will inclyne, our matter in varians may well be determyned without unquietnes if ye please./Your certificat brought from Andwerp (wherof I have receavid the copie) is of credit, for it wantith auctorite and besydes that the same etendith to smalle purpose, ye have clene left owt the princypall matter, wherof ye be not yngnorant, which was that after your arryvall at Andwerp, comandement was gyven by the Governour of th'Englishe nation in the Kinge's name to staie lading of your ship for x daies, bycawse of the hyndring sewtes our nation had at my Ladie Regent Court for the half on the hondreth; and soche comandement being geven, Yea, and lettres writtin over from the Counsaylle for the same, what cowld be done by obedient subjectes but obeye? Or what fault can ye in soche a case impute unto us for the breache of your daies of loding? Trewly, my freinde, nothing ner no more then lately shippes laden ther, for London cowld when they were staed xiiij daies after they were loden. Therfor when ye have done what ye can, ye shall fynde that in soche cases every man must be content to beare his awne fortune, and so consequently must ye take in godo parte the losse had by the tempest and thanck God id was no worsse, ner so yll as a great m that were soncke at the same place wher ye were, even as if it had chaunced my goodnes had bene laden and perisshed by the tempest, I must have bene contentyd and have boerne the losse patiently./Thus, if ye will without afection to your awne cawse ponder that which ye ought to do by reason, ye maie sone perswade yourself to that which it semeth yet ye ar not myndid: but I hope ye will now ponder all thinges well, and so use me that ther growe no contention bitwene us, to bothe our unquietnes.

Je croy qu'il sera venu des navires d'Espaigne, car j'ay advis qu'il y avoit 4 navires Englesse en Calis, lesquels sont partie; aussy, Jan Meullebroucq m'escript qu'il a achete 250 bottes de vins de Xerres des le 15e de Decembre pour vous, comme appert par le double des lettre que ay delivre a vostre frere Richart Jansson comme croy, quy a vous aura envoye partant.

Je croy que avant ay receu la presente aures recus lettre de Jan Meullebroucque par mer, car il m'escript qu'il vous a rescript par ung nomme Lucas Beer, lequel vous aporte une lettre de change pour nous de 2,000 ducas sur Blase Saunders, a payer a Londres ou en ceste ville, a nostre chois; et sy par cas le dit Lucas ne fust arrive, je vous envoye la seconde lettre adsy de le faire accepter net, luy dires que voulons estre paye en ceste ville a 38 portant pour ducat a 5 de May, comme la lettre de change dict; l'ayant faict accepter me l'envoyeres, et qu'il vous dict qu'y aura ichy la commission adsy que quand le jour sera venus de le povoir recepvoir.

I have sondry tymes wryton unto you that Rondynelly and his companye be men that will not have one daye escaped after their monney ys due, even as the treuthe ys, tor he seaseth not 5 or 6 tymes per jour to demaund his monney of Mychell Mulier and me, and we be nother furnysned with monney, or have anny order gyven theirfore. The more monney that we make by saeles and otherwyse, the more we be in dept, as to me yt semyth, which I understond not, but hope to be advertised trom you and also from my cosyn Richard of sondr/y/ tninges, wherof I never had knowleage./Nycoloche hathe dyvers tymes demaunded iiijli of me for brocage /which/ you owe hym, he sayeth.

My cosyn Johnson promysed payment before his departeur, and even so dyd he to Oste Mahue for a smale some for my master's (1b) accomp/t/_for the bettering of wull; but he ys gone and Lette no wor/d/ for remembraunce theirof. Soche smale matters not cared for will nothing augment a man his good name, and even so have I wryton hym this daye, as I have ot a great sort of lackis which I have of understonding of his doings here, which I am sure will make hym angry, eyen as he wrote you befor that he was. But that anger I passe not moche or, having never burthened hym but with matters of treuth, as God only knowith, etc., Who defend us from this secret ennemitie, which is most ongodly and onnaturall. He wold never wryte me or breke unto me his mynd after anny soche sorte that he semed to be angry, moche lesse snowld he do you to understond his anger, etc./I hope, even as I have done this ij dayes, that I shall receave my saulf-conduict sealed, and also a cleare dispatche for our wynes from the Court, but yeat I have receyved nothing. My comyng from Brucelles withowt the same was only to speake with Robert Andrew, who departed ij howers before my comyng. He hathe lette me an abstract of your accompt, the copie wherof, and also of myne accompt, I will send you by the next, to th'intent you may understond the state of your, busynes here, assuring you that my hoope was at my comyng over, and princypally after we had made our saelles of Thomas Egerton's goodes, that we showld have done a good feat of bestowing our awne monney in hering and other thinges, wherby a great sorte have moche proffyted; and to be short, we have done of ourselves nothing that I know of, which dothe more greve me then all other cares, and espetially fearing a great losse, whereas a certayne gaynes might have bene gotten, etc. And yeat must I dwell here for nothinge, and may not thinke the thing grevous, etc. This daye I have taken of yong Conney, factor for Peter Bate, 100li Englishe for usans at 15s 9d, and lykewyse must I of force take more money for the clearing or your debtes presently due, trusting you will accept my bylles, etc. With Rondinelly I hoope to agre for 3 pur cent untill the 15 of Maye, at which tyme he dothe recon withowt anny delay to have the same interest with his prinsypall, and even so must Mychell Mulier be bound yf we go thorrowgh, as I recon to do.

And so we departed, unto this day, le xxviijth in July, my Lord Deputy (of Calais) sent for me, whose demand of me was, why I durst, contrary to the ordinance of the town, deliver any writ or subpoena unto any soldier in the King's retinue here, without first to give him knowledge thereof; and that for my so doing contrary to the ordinance I was worthy to be punished./I answered ayen that I did know no such ordinance of the town, wherefore I did not give his lordship no knowledge thereof; and besides, that this matter which Burdon must appear for in England is a matter that cannot be determined by the law here, but in England, because that it concerns land in England. And my lord said, that if he had been by at the delivery of the writs, Burdon should have received none of me, and yet I should have gone to ward. And my answer was, that I did not know I had deserved any such punishment, and so many words more . between us which were too long to write. But to conclude, as far as I perceive by my Lord, and also he said Burdon should not appear for all the delivering of the writ, but my Lord and the Council of Calais will write to my Lord Chancellor for him, for his answer. For my lord saieth he cannot be spared out of the town because of his office, which is, reporter of all the strangers within the town, and the hearing time draweth nigh, wherefore he may the worse be spared./Your prentice,/John Johnson./t	sara	60af9ecbf038043336624b28	Johnson & Company	xx-xx-1514	John	Male	Johnson		Protestant	Merchant; draper and stapler	sara		626aaf5ea6ff4c7af64228e1		xx-xx-1485	Edward	Male	Montagu			Lawyer and judge;  Chief Justice of the Court of the King's Bench between 1537 and 1545	sara	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Montagu_(judge)

Mr. Smyth payd for Mr. Tanfelde's 8s, and I am wer sure it could be no better than that I have bought./Your lettres to William Gifford and Adrian of Donckerke (4) come to my haundes after that Thomas Flecton was departed from hens, but I will send them by the next trusty person that goeth./My monney of Bartram de la Salle I cannot gett as yet, wherfore I am in great doubt that it will not serve Mr. Cave's pourpos, for Mr. Smyth is dayly charged from him with payementes, as he shewed me a litill before the writing hierof; and I declaired agen unto him all my mater, wherfor I suppose he wil provide for monneye some other way, and so performe his commisions, as I thinke you shall heare of by this berar./From Calleis I have harde nothing as yet of your sute to my Lord Gray. And for newes from hens, knowe ye that even according to my writing on Sonday last, I se the Quene (5) and the Lady Retcheford suffer within the Tower the day following, (2) whos sowles (I doubt not) be with God, for thay made the moost godly and Christyan's end that ever was hard tell of (I thinke) sins the worlde's creation, uttering thayer lyvely faeth in the blode of Christe onely, with wonderfull pacience and constancye to the death; and with goodly wordes and stedfast countenances, thay desired all christen peopele to take regard unto thayer worthy and just punnisshement with death, for thayer offences against God hainnously from their youth upward in breaking of all His comandementes, and also agenst the Kinge's Royall Majesty very daungeriously; wherfor thay, being justly condempned (as thay sayed) by the people (I say) to take example at them for amendement of thayer ungodly lyves, and gladdly to obey the King in all thinges; for whos preservation thay did hartely pray, and willed all people so to do, comending thayer sowles to God, and ernestly calling for mercy uppon Him, Whom I besieche to geve us grace, with suche faeth, hope and charite at our departing owt of this miserable world, to come to the fruytion of His Godhed in joy everlasting. Amen./Your loving brother,/Otwell Johnson/With my harty comendacions unto Mr. Cave and Maistres Cave, not forgetting my syster your wiff.

OTWELL JOHNSON TO JOHN JOHNSON//At London, the 2de in July, 1546//Brother,/With my harty comendacions to you, my syster your wiff (mother to fayre yong boye I trust, long befor this tyme), and to my power Mary, not being able (as I doubt) to beare nether boye nor wenche, with my brother Mr. Francis, (1a) and all other our frendes in your quarters, this shall lett you understond that sins my coming to London, I have receyved the lettres unto you hierinclosed, or bound with, and have aunswered as moche of them as haeth ben in my knowledge; the rest I referre to you./The thinges recited in Robert Androwe's lettre I have receyved; and also, by the shippe that brought the Harlem frisado, dyvers other small parcelles with thayer prices: vic't, white threde, 4 lb at 28 stuvers the lb; iij several lb more of 8s 4d, 6s 8d, and 5s; a painted s/t/ory/e/ of the scripture, cost 7s Fl.; ij small tonekins of capers cont. 4 lb 0.5, cost 4s 6d; and a thirde, cont. a stope of olyves, cost vjd. I pray you send me word if you can, befor my coming downe to you agen, what shal be done with thies thinges. Maistres Smyth wold gladly have some of your threde, but she lyketh not the coursest sorte, and yet I suppose all that sorte was bought for her. Lett me knowe if you can shortely of what sortes she shall have anny./From Calleis yesterday is arryved Richard Harwoode's shippe, who haeth brought the xij Leight cloethes in ij cases that Robert Androwe's lettre doeth make mencion of, the same being sent thiether directly from Andwarpe by Peter Symons, and in your absence directed to Robert Mattres my gossep, whom I have allowed for freight and chargis of the same thiether, and have paid hier the lyke agen and tne Kinge's custome also, which is ijs of a piese, so that these frisados stand us in double chargis, and therfor we shall be the lesse gainners by them. I have receyved them but this day a-lond, and for that cause have not yett shewed them to anny person, but I trust not to kepe them long./The Harlems cost at Andwarpe clear abourd the shippe 23li 1s 2d Fl., and the custome, freight and other chargis hier amount to 17s st. or theraboute, so that thay stond /us/ in above 4li Fl. apiese, which is full xvj grotes a yard, and the monneys accompt but at 25s; and yet Thomas Lokke and other men serve Mr. White th'alderman for 5s 6d st. the yard of Harlems, and for 5s the Leightes, which is a veray slender reconing in my judgement, and skantly wourth a man's venture. Well, if I can dispatches oures for 17 grotes and 15.5 thay shall away, and than you may advise yourself whether you will medle with moo or not./Your lynnen cloeth wil not yet away nether, for uppon this peace men stay themselves uppon hope of moche more plenty coming in of all thinges, and indede, Frensshemen come in dayly with Frenshe wins and canvas./Th'exchaunge is up agen, above xxiiijs, as you may perceave by Robert Androwe's lettre, and hier sins my coming it is ryssen to 24s 4d at sight, and for the payementes (so it past not tne 15th of Septembre) at 24s 8d, and some 10d; for the last of the same monneth, not under 25s. I dirferre the taking up of anny monney for you untill I have made sale of the frisados and lynnen cloeth, which I intend to do (God willing) befor my coming doune, though I make my wiff lay withoute my compaigny 8 or 10 dayes longer then I spake of at my departing: mais la bouche cousue. Besides the monney that I shall make of the said wares, as I trust, my hope is to have 40 or 50li of myn owne to bring downe with me, and so (perchaunce) I shall nede to take but a litle by th'exchaunge. Be you assured you shal be charged no further but as veray necessite shall constraine me./Newes owte of Flanders Robert Androwe doeth write you, and we here hier sins that tyme that moost of th'Emperour's men that he hadde raysed to do him service agenst the Germans (as the bruyte went) have refused to warre agenst th'Electoures of th'Empire, and so he shal be shrodely served of his pourpos; (1c) and furthermore, some saythe the Germains will depose Fernandus from his Kingdome of Hungary and Seignorie of Osterwike, bycause thay will no lenger trust anny suche Papist as he is, to be governeur of thayer frontiers toward the Turkes. (2c) What the conclusion of this bruite will prove unto, God knowith. Indede, my maister shewed me on Sonday last that the King hadde newes of vj^xx M. men that th'Emperour was appointed to rayse veray shortely, and that his quarell agenst the Germains was not for anny cause of religion, but for thayer certain disobedience agenst him in thinges that concerne th'Empire. Moost men ellis thinke otherwise, but vous cognosces l'home. (3c)/Our newes hier of Doctour Crome's canting, recantyng, decanting or rather double-canting, be thies: that on Sonday last, before my Lorde Chauncelour, (4c) the Duke of Norfocke, my Lorde Great Maister, (5c) Mr. Riche, Mr. Chauncelour of the Tentes, (6c) with the Suthwelles, (7c) Pope, (8c) and other nobles and knyghtes; and on th'other side the Bisshoppes of London and Wourcester, (1d) all principall doctoures and denes, besides gay grayamesse, and a rable of /o/ther marked people: the reverent father first-named openly declaired his true measning and right understonding (as he sayd, and according to his conscience) of the vj or vij articles you hard of, as he shuld have done uppon the ijde Sonday after Ester, but that he was letted from his sayd true intent by the perswasions of certain perverse-mynded persons, and by the sight of lewde and ungodly bookes and writinges, for the which he was veray sorry, and desired the audience to beware of suche bookes, for under the fayer appierance of them was hidde a daungerous accombraunce of Christen consciences, and so exhorted all men to embrace auncientnes of Catholike doctrine and forsake newfanggelnes./On Monday following, quondam Bisshop Saxon, Maistres Askewe, Christofer White, one of Maistres Fayre's sones, and a tayliour that come from Colchester or theraboute, wer araigned at the Guyldhall, and receyved thayer judgement of my Lord Chauncelour and the Counsai/il/ to be burned, and so wer comitted to Newegate agen. But sins that tyme, the forsaid Saxon and White have renounced thayer opinions, and the talke goeth that thay shall chaunce to escape the fyer for this viage; but the gentilwo/man/ and th'other man remayne in stedfast mynd, and yet she haeth ben rakked sins her condempnacion (as men say) which is a straunge thing in my understonding. The Lord be mercifull to us all. (3d) With /M/aistres Fayrey I have comuned concerning her monney, and she haeth aunswered me that whan she doeth intend to occupie her monney she will let me knowe, for to write to Robert Androwe to make it over. Wull she haeth bought owte of Hartfordshier some, and owte of Cottiswold she may have at xvjs and a grote, as moche as she will, good, midle and refuse, as the countre doeth gyve it, and not otherwise; but she dareth not medle with moche withoute your advise therunto, which she requyreth you to be certefied of as shortely as you can./Your milne you forgate to shewe me who shuld have it, and therfor I pray you do it befor my departing hens agen; and my gold pourses, I thanke you, you kept also. And thus remembring no mo thinges, but that Mr. Dunne your hoerse haeth a newe maister this day in Smythfeld for Ls st., I bidde you moost hartely well to fare.

JOHN JOHNSON TO ANTHONY CAVE//Copie of a lettre/to Mr. Anthony Cave,/at Tickford.//Jhesus, the 12 in September, anno 1545, at London.//After dew comendations, trusting of your helth, and praing you I may be comendid unto my awnte and other my frendes, etc., yt maie please you to understond that I have receavid youre lettre by Gorge Graunt this mornyng, which I well perseave./Touching Ernesden Woodes, ye shall perseave by a copie of the particulers hierin sent you, how I have obtayned them of the surveiour's clarkes. But before the having of them on Thursdaye last (I beyng at Westminster to receave them, as I had bene apointid before by the clarkes to do) chaunsyd ther to mete with Mr. Hatten youre neighbour, who taried to speke with some of the same clarkes (for owne (1a) of them were then at home ); and so after other comynication, and that he had told me he was with you on Thursdaye, he asked me whether my sewte was ther to have anny certificat for woodes, and I then without anny suspection, for I remembred ye had shewed me that Hatton had told you he wold staye Aernsden Woddes for you, said that I cam for a certyficat of the wooddes at Lathbury that he knewe of: wherunto he answered me, "Ye maye well have a certyficat of them, but to put you owt of dowte they were sold in Marche last past, and so I told Mr. Cave at my last beinge with hym", sainge further to me that it was a freinde of youres that had bowght yt, and that yt myght be easlye convayed to your haundes. I asked hym yf he hymselfe had bowght yt, but he wolde make me no answer but that a freind of youres had bowght yt, and further said that yf the clarkes wolde looke further in their bookes they shold fynd a vendition on the hedd of the same, but bycawse the clarkes came not home and we had tarryed longe, we bothe departed thens, Mr. Hatton to the Court and I to London./And the next mornynge sent Ambrose (1b) for the partyculers aforesaid that I send you herein enclosed, whiche he brought me, and woirde from the clarkes that they knew of no sale of the same, as the same Ambrose can at large infourme you. For the serche and triall of this matter in Mr. Handbie's (2b) bookes, wether it be purchased or not, my brother can showe you what hathe bene done, howbeit Hanbie cannot yet be had at leysor. If I can trie it not to be sold, then will I get it ratyd with the particulers; if not, I intend to go thorowe with the residew at the farthist on Mondaie, for hetherto I cowld do no more then is done: for the perticulers which I had owt of Cavendishe office, wherin is conteyned the ij parcelles that Robert Tanfeld shuld purchase, and the portion of the tythe of Willin of xs by the yeare, is at the Surveior's of the Woodis, who must write on the same that ther is no wood on the groundes, or ellis I shal not get it ratyd, and it wil be this daie or tomorowe or I can get it owt of the Surveior's haundes, for anny intreament or promyse that I can make to hym for the same./As for the patronage of Checheley, forasmoche as ye forsake the parsonage that was ones ratyd, looke not for it, for if it shuld be earnestly movyd it myght be a staie to your hole booke. Ye maie another tyme cause some othor man /to/ put it in his booke, and so have itt conveyd to your haundes./By ought that I can perseave, it is owt of dowte ye shal not have the patronage by purchasing of the pention ther: nevertheles I cannot perseave how the same maie now be left owt, seing the same is alredy certified with other particulers, which shall passe all under one rate; and therfore seing it is but xli matter, I purpose not to staie therin, and even so Mr. Wood gevith me counsaille./How sone your thinges wil be brought to the rating, and so far fourthe as ther maie be monney paid and sewerties put in for the rest, I cannot certifie you, howbeit ye may be assewryd I will do what I can therin: and bycause I perseave your desier is to have me to bring the matter so farre as the drawing of the bookes, and then to comyt the matter to Mr. Wood and my brother, (1c) I do intend to perfourme your desier, and not to leave it untyll it be set in a good forwardnes and owt of dowte; and then I shall comyt the same, with soche instructions as ye have geven me, to Mr. Wood. As for my brother, he hathe so moche busynes with his master (2c) that he cannot intend it, by reason that his sayd master is apointid within these x daies in company of my Lord Admyrall and other, and so to Bolloigne to reyse the seige, Our Lord send them gode spede./The parcellis late of the possescyons of Delaprey, in the tenure of Birchemore, Mr. Woode sens his beinge here hathe serched for in th'auditours' bookes, and their it aperith that Sir John Wyllyams hath bowght it; theirfore if ye will have it, ye must make freindes to hym for it./The monney ye had at Callais in Humphre Lightfotte's haundes is apoynted to be sent to Andwerp, as ye wylled me yt showld; and I have nowe agreed with Edmond Calthrop for a Cli to be receavid of hym, xlli st. the next weeke, and lxli at Mychelmas: for the same he must have after xxvs viijd for the pounde, xd in the paymentes of these Sinxon martes.

Yf my oncle Tanfeild be contented, he must seall yt before wytnes, and even so mist ye, and ye must wryt the wytnes underneth that it was sealled and delivered for your deades in their presentes, and so send th'obligation hether agayne./Bycawse that ever sens ye entred into boundes for me to Wylmot ye have (as I perceyve) conseaved a more mystrust in me then yt semythe ye dyd before (by what occasyon yt commyth, or by whose meanes I knowe not) I was moved to wryte you as I ded in my former lettre, and allso I was the more moved theirunto bycawse ye semed to be dyspleased with me not longe sens, when I wold not graunt to go to Callais, the sees beinge then troubled with Frenchemen, and that nowe contrarye to that your motion, ye stayed me abowt other busynes. I do not forget that ye have browght me up from my chyldhod, no more then I trust ye do remember the faithfull service that I have done you, and theirfore I praye you exteme me to be bothe faithfull unto you, and soche one as wold be glad to do you moche more pleaser and servyce then it is in my power to doo./At Callais hathe bene sold, as I am informed sens my commynge hether, to the Haerlemers apon L M. felles, wherof I have worde that vij M. of my felles be sold.

I am not entred altogether of my awne seking, but occasioned by others' begynnynges, which yf it please God I maie lyve to see th'end, yf not His wyl be done, for I make no other reconyng, supposing not to displease God to be occupied while I am hier in that which ys my calling, and in an unsertayne place to make sewer accompt of nothinge, but that Gode's will shal be, for further then He hathe of me determyned to followe, my litle doinges or great doinges can nether help or further./Therfore Sir, thoughe moest gentle ye offre to do for me as moche as for anny freind ye have lyving, and do not refewse to be bound with me to Mr. Doylie, accord/ing/ to my request, yet yf ye thincke it to be soche hasard of me 1 j by meanes of my doinges and occupienges, that ye wold require anny other contre-bound then by obligation, I praie you be not displeased, for I wil not trowble you ner geve you no cawse of disquitnes, for if I cannot satisfie Mr. Doylie otherwise, I wyll fynd meanes to repaie hym his monney. And as for our reconynges (I meane those that touche our joinct doinges) I suppose they stand so that we maie sone clear eche other, onles it be for the laste wull I bought of you at Callais, wherof is writting bitwene us; and therfore a smalle tyme, Yea, a lettre or ij bitwene us myght make those accompes clere, so that my busynes shuld not neade to drive it of untill Christemes ner Candlemes. But if ye meane all yore reconynges which I have used to make upe, lyke as I hope to do them in ordre by Candlemes, so I praie you be so good to spare me when my other busynes dothe ymporte me so that I cannot intend it./With Purve my agrement ye write to be content, howbeit ye thincke it unreasonable considring the tyme. I wrote you the cawse of the doinge of it, and that he must have but xlli in hand, wherof paid hym xxli; the rest he shall tarie for untill Candlemes for me, having made no other promes. But if this doing of myne with Pourve shuld so disconte/nte/ youe as ye wold reckon the want of having accompt of feIIes past or sochelyke unto me, I shal be pleased ye be not bourdened with this my doinge with hym, bycawse indeade I did yt without your consent, for against your goodwill I wold be lothe to medle./Mr. Lovet I will paie an Cli unto according unto your writinge, but to helpe hym to gold (which I fynd at xijd the pond, di.-sufferans) I am not lyke, for that it semeth he supposed to have angelles for a smalle matter in the pound, but it is not yet comme to that. Also, in comynicaton with Mr. Lovet, I perseave his meanyng is not to make a lease of his howse at Battlebridge, but to delyver with the leasse xlli, to have yerely a ton of wyne at Batlebridge./But considering no lykelod of wyne yet awhile to be under vgjli, and sometyme not under viijli, I thinck it moche to geve after that rate for xlli: so I myght paie after xvj on the houndreth, not pourposing to make soche a bargayne; for yf I maie not have Mr. Lovette's howse more frelie then to becomme bond, I shall shift as well as I maie, desiring not to be boerne in hand /onles/ I have pleasu/r/ showed me when I shall paie for it. I have refferred all unto you in that matter, and what agrement soever ye make I shal be content, even as I am content to geve hym a pipe of wyne for his goodwille, right hartely thancking you for your goodwill./I have no newes for you Sir, more then my oncle Cave this bringer can showe you, unto whome I refferre all, bothe of the proclamation and other. And when I have your aunswer unto my last lettre per Cocken I shall further write you of my purpose for wares owt of Flaunders./So knowith the Lord, Howe kepe you.

And for aunswer understond first, that from Floore I receyved your ij loed of wull the 11th of this present, payed for carriage according to your writing, sent the ij di.-barrelles hering for your brother Robert (1a) and your brother Bretain (the 3de for your brother Vyllers shal be sent at the carte's retourne agen), and also I sent the v pieses of barras canvas and packethrede that you writt of with the salte for your foresaid brother./The wull is sett at Mr. Newton's, and I shall intreate Haynes to do therwith as you write nowe, and that with suche spede as he can./Unto Mr. Coope's servant, bringer of your bill, was payed the 11th in this sayd monneth at sight by Mr. Smyth, 16li, 16s 0d st., owte of the rest of your accompt; and the residue was delyvered unto me the morrowe after, (2a) with very harty thankes from the same Mr. Smyth for the barrell of hering that you have geven him./Touching Thomas Wilkes, understond that his stay of part of your bill was for the xxiijs iiijd that you aske allowaunce of. for your attornishippe in sale of his wull and felles: sayeng that at his departing from Calleis, his measning was not but that Henry Suthwyke shuld have sold his wares, withoute anny allowance of attornishippe, namely inasmoche as he hadde an honnest bargain at his haundes for a gret part of his felles, and yett you recon his felles unto him sold under his commission, which he is not utterly discontented with, but doeth thinke it strange to be put to the charge of attornisshippe besides; and this he willed me to certefye you of. Make him therfor suche aunswer as you thinke good, for I have sayed the receyt of the rest of your monney (and have your bill agen) untill I heare further from you. He is very willing to pay me the said rest, and doeth very liberallye offer to lend me xxli more for to do your buysines with, if I will, withoute anny mencion making of t'hold mater that you and I did doubte of. And thus I pray you, lett me knowe of your mynde hierin shortely./I wold have towched somewhat of this mater in a letter to Henry Suthwyke, but he is departed from Calleis towards Andwarpe for 8 dayes ago, as I have perceaved by a lettre of his unto,you which I have opened, and is nowe hierwith enclosed, (1b) emonges other.

Advertise me of your mynd, and I will assay further what may be done hierin./The same Richard shewed me within thies ij dayes that Mr. Judge, (1c) his maister, and Mr. Offley or Woodroeff (as I remembre) have concluded thayer viage to Venyce that you harde a mocion of at Calleis, and do send a dossen serplers apiese thiether, for the which pourpos Henry Bostocke went over yesterday in the morening, and shall be one of them that shall go to the place self with the wulles. As the foresaid Richard promised me that he wold have certefyed you nowe of thole order of the mater, but by resone of other lawfull impedimentes he haeth overslipped it, and therfor I do hier thus touche the mater, even as I have superfycially herde it of him. Whan I can gett him to write, I will send it you with spede./From William Gyfford I do hierwith send you a lettre which I receyved on Monday last, for th'ordre of your buysines in his haundes. The tonneckes of capers I will receyve shortely of Cuthbert his compaignon hier; send me word what shal be done with them./Mr. Sergiaunt Saunders' and Mr. Parson's of Kylworthes (2c) hering shal be sent as shortely as I can, or at furthest when your cartes come hiether agen from Floore./I have hier dyaper for a dossen of napkens of youres, which John my knave (3c) forgett to put into your mayle./I pray you, if thay be not promised, lett them be for this my power London howsehold, for I have nede of suche implementes. It is but very course stueff, but good ynough for me./I trust to be rydde shortely of John my man, for I have writton very ernestly to his father in the mater, and therfor I pray you, if you can espye some propre boy for me emonges any of your frendes, wysshe him unto me, for I will in no condicion kepe this lubber that I have.

I pray you, [repai]re to him at your coming over; his lodging is in the Mason[dieu] as I can lerne. I suppose he will declaire unto you his direct mynd[e] of my coming to him thiether or to Callais, for at his sayd departing yesterday, he made the mater somewhat doubtefull whether he wold send for me or not./Furthermore Sir, yesterday departed all my maistere's servauntes alongsees; and unto one of the thre chieff captaines, named Thomas Scott, I owe a litle monney which I send hierwith in the glove abovesaid, and a bill of his reconing therwith. I pray you comend me very hartely unto him, and desire him to take myn absens from him at his departing hen[s] in good parte, for myn accombraunce with my maister was my onely lett, or el[l]is I wold not have ben from him. And thus in moche hast ended, I bydde you well to fare./Yf the said Scott talke unto you of a gelding of his that is lefte hier with me, I pray you lend him some monney uppon [him] if you may spare it, and you shall have the occupyeng of the gelding all this sommer at your owne pleasur. He is very fayer and lusty, and wil be sold reasonably: comen with hym therof if you thing it good./Your loving brother,/Otwell Johnson.//Add.
